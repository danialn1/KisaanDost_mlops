This manual will raise awareness and provide decision support information about opportunities at farm and how to do basic farming for subsistence and market and ultimately increase the income of farmers and improve their livelihoods. Pohnpei and Yap States currently produce limited amount of food locally and export is also limited. The imports of substantial quantities of vegetables, fruits and root crops is amounting to millions of dollars annually. This is partly owing to the fact that the necessary information on crop production locally is not readily available to assist producers in their production. This manual is designed to provide guidelines on seedling production and management, plant spacing, cropping program, soil fertility and crop protection. It is hoped that this manual will contribute modestly to the goal of improving vegetable production in the country. \n",

            "3 Farming basics Introduction With so much emphasis today on eating natural, organic foods not to mention the rising costs associated with buying them, many people are considering growing their own vegetables in a home garden. Its very easy to grow your own vegetables, and at harvest time, vegetable gardening is a very rewarding pastime. All your garden really needs is sunshine (68 hours of sun each day, in the summer), some soil, fertilizer, and a little attention to watering, weeding and pest management. As a gardening beginner, your first vegetable garden will require the largest amount of work, but dont let that dissuade you the work you put in up front wont have to be repeated next year, and the rewards speak for themselves. Why start your own farm? Across the world, many people are having little farms. In FSM most people have access to land and the climate is suitable for crop production. And for the cost of seeds, tools, and water, theyre enjoying food thats as fresh and local as it can possibly be, all while spending less time shopping for groceries and more time at home, connecting with their family and friends. As you can see, there are many great reasons to start your own farm. Apart from allowing you to grow your own food, conserving energy and saving money, own farm will also help to control runoff from rainfall and guard against flooding. A farm can act as a sound buffer, lowering noise levels in your neighborhood. Your farm will attract a variety of local and migratory wildlife like birds and butterflies, not to mention helping to conserve important creatures like bees who are vital to our ecosystem and helping to reduce CO2 in our atmosphere, replacing it with oxygen. Additionally, a farm is a great space for both children and adults to experience the outdoors, and get off the sofa. A garden can create ground shade, helping with cooling, and can work as a filter for dust and pollutants. Picking a good spot for your garden Now that youve decided to start your farm, the first step is to find the perfect location. There are several things you should keep in mind: Start Small. As we mentioned, your first farm is typically the most work to set up, so starting small is a good idea. Set up a manageable area for your garden bed(s), whether they are in the ground, raised beds, or in containers, and know what youre \n",
            "---------------\n",
            "4 going to plant (and the space requirements of those plants) ahead of time. Sunlight. Sunlight is the most important thing for any farm. Vegetables require at least six hours of sun each day and if you can get 8 hours, thats better. Dont worry too much about afternoon or morning sun, as long as the garden gets at least six hours total, youre golden. Good Soil. As farmers, we know that good soil means good plants! When looking at the soil in your own ground, darker tends to be better, but just about any soil is workable as long as its not full of rocks, roots, or other obstructions. Even mediocre soil can be improved with minerals, manure, and sand to make it excellent. And, if all else fails, a raised bed with formulated soil is always an option. Water source. Apart from sun and soil, water is the third piece of the puzzle to make a healthy garden. Choose a location close to a water source like river, rain water collection, a hose, well, or other hydrant where you can easily make sure the garden stays watered and while were at it, plants dont grow in totally soaked soil, so avoid areas that tend to collect rainwater. Higher ground is best! Wind shelter. This one is especially important on a rooftop, or out in an open plain. Find natural windbreakers in the surrounding area or consider building a fence to protect your plants from the wind to minimize damage from wind exposure. Choosing what crops to plant Now that you have a location, its time to decide what to plant. Youll want to maximize your space and grow plants suited to your local area, as well as considering the time vs. reward corn, for example, is delicious, but takes up lots of space and takes months to get a single harvest, while pole beans are quire space-efficient and produce beans for weeks. Easy to grow. For the beginning, having vegetables that are basically foolproof is a great plan. Plants like Chinese cabbage, tomatoes, gourds like squash and eggplant, greens such as lettuce or Swiss chard, and root vegetables like taro tend to be very simple. Suitable for your region. When planning your farm, pay a visit to your farmers market and find out whats already grown locally. This will help you to ensure you arent fighting an uphill battle in getting a plant that isnt exactly suited to your area to thrive plus, by growing what other farmers are growing, you can always go to those folks for help if needed.

            "5 Companion planting. Companion planting can help ensure that all your plants thrive by assisting with pest control. By planting companions next to each other, the idea is that we want all the natural pests attracted to the first plant to be repelled by the second, and vice-versa. For example, onion pairs well with tomatoes and leafy greens like lettuce, but if planted next to beans or peas you may run into pest troubles. Finding seeds/seedlings Buying/receiving seeds can be pretty overwhelming for farmers because of the sheer volume of different companies and varieties out there. The best advice is, Read the label or, Ask your extension officer. This will let you know how difficult the plant is to grow, when to plant, and whats required. Planning your farm Farmers usually make mistake here. First time farms can easily get out of hand, or unwieldy, or fall victim to neglect, wind, waterlogging, or pests. To prevent your farm experience from being a disaster, take some time to plan the farm. Layout No matter what kind of layout you end up using for your farm, the first thing to think about is location. Choose a basically level area in higher ground if possible, for good drainage. Take in mind that sun is a concern (68 hours) as well as protection from wind. Raised beds Raised bed gardening has become one of the most popular way of growing vegetables today. The way they allow you to control space, soil, water levels, and location make them ideal for many gardeners. If you go with a raised bed layout, construct beds that are no more than 34 feet wide, with space for walking paths in between. This will ensure FAO/ S.M. Naim Khalid FAO/ S.M.

            "6 that youre able to properly attend to and harvest every plant. Traditional rows For those who have the space, traditional row gardening can be a great option. Planting vegetables in long rows allows you to increase the space between plants, improving air flow around them and giving them more space to grow. Heres a rule of thumb for row gardening try to plant the taller plants toward the west, and shorter toward the east. That way your shorter plants dont spend those vital sunshine hours in the shade of the taller ones. Square foot gardening For beginner farmers, square foot gardens often tend to be a great way to begin. Larger gardens are prone to weeds and can be overwhelming for the novice. Square foot gardening is similar to raised bed gardening, but it is further subdivided into individual square-foot plots. Mulching For farmers, the purpose of mulch is fairly straightforward: mulch is like a barrier keeping sunlight and ambient air out of the soil. Mulching allows soil to stay cooler, meaning less stress on your plant roots from heat, and in cooler months. On the other hand, it does create cool, dark spaces that are the favored environments of Giant African snails, slugs, earwigs, and other undesirables so only use a thin layer. Mulchshould not touch the stem of plants. When to plant When considering the question of when to plant, youll have to go back to the question of what to plant. Remember, reading all those labels on your seed packets will ensure that youre planting things at the right times. Choose seeds that make good companions, and thrive at similar intervals for the best beginner gardening experience. FAO/ S M. Naim Khalid Figure 3: Production in furrows and rows \n",

            "7 If you want to think ahead, consider growing something that thrives in heat and can be harvested early like Chinese cabbage, and then replacing them as the weather cools with a cool-weather plant like broccoli. Of course, if youd rather simply do one planting and one harvest, especially as a beginner, thats just fine too. Improving the soil Most soils are entirely capable of growing a vegetable garden and even mediocre soil can be improved. For a really successful garden, some soil improvements is a must. Lets take a look at some of the ways you can improve your soil. Testing the soil Now, brace yourself, because were going to talk a little chemistry. Dont panic, you dont need to be a scientist. So, as you may remember from chemistry or biology class, pH is a measure of the acidity of a substance remember, 7 is neutral, and a pH lower than 7 is acidic, while a pH above 7 is basic. Soil is no exception, and it has a pH value, and unsurprisingly, plants tend to like neutral soil. For more information and help please contact the extension agents and local agriculture department. Clearing weeds The amount of time youll spend worrying about weeds, in a sense, depends on which style garden you use. While square-foot gardens and raised beds using controlled soils can remain fairly weed-free, a traditional row garden can inherit weeds from plant life that inhabited the soil before it was tilled. A good way to prevent weeds from starting is to smother them. After clearing the ground for your garden, just leave the clippings of the grass and weeds that were there previously, and cover the area with newspaper. Keep the newspaper damp by watering it each day, and walk over it to keep everything pressed down. This will discourage the more stubborn weeds from re-growing.

            "8 As the plant matter from your clippings begins to decay, earthworms will be attracted, and they will aerate the soil and add nutrients a bonus! Compost Compost is a great way to create extremely nutrient-rich soil, and it couldnt be easier to make. Just create some layers of organic material dry leaves, kitchen veggie scraps, shredded paper, plant clippings, and just a little bit of soil. Over time, this will turn into something called humus, and its excellent for building soil. Further details on how to make compost is presented in Annex 1. Manure In addition to composting, plenty of fertilizers and other synthetic soil enrichment methods are around to help improve soil. However, for many gardeners, nothing is better than the tried-and-true method of manure. In comparison, manure contains a little less nutrient content than the sparkly synthetic fertilizers, but nothing is better at providing carbon and carbon compounds. This is organic material that helps build and fortify the structure of soil, and thats something no fertilizer can do. Planting the crops Now that you have your garden laid out, your soil prepared, and your seeds at the ready, its time to get to the good stuff: planting your garden. Planting time is the second most exciting time to be a gardener (the first is, of course, harvest time) this is when you can finally put all the hard (but worthwhile) work of building your first garden behind you, and really begin the enjoyable process of growing your own food. Plants can be cultivated by direct seeding or transplanting. How to plant the seeds The first step to actually utilizing your garden to grow delicious vegetables is to plant your seeds. If you ask ten gardeners how they plant their seeds, youll likely get ten different answers, as everyone develops their own routine. But, as a general guide, heres our preferred method of starting seeds for beginners. Seeds can be directly planted in soil or grown in nursery and then transplanted to prepared beds. Begin by marking out rows with stakes on either side of the garden, and stretching string between them. Alternatively, you can use a long, straight piece of wood as a guide. Whichever method you use, use a hoe or trowel along your guide to cut a furrow into the soil. It should look like a V-shaped indentation a few inches deep refer to your seed packets for more specific depth requirements. Now that you have your row defined, you can distribute the seeds along the row, taking care to distribute them \n",
            "---------------\n",
            "9 more or less evenly in small groups, or individually for larger seeds. Dont be afraid to use additional seeds. This will help cut down on loss should some of your seeds fail to germinate. Finally, once your row has been populated with seeds, use your trowel or hoe to pull fine soil over the seeds take care to avoid large clods of soil and rocks. Finally, give the soil some taps with your tool of choice to firm it and ensure that moisture in the soil has good contact with the seeds, and to help the soil to retain moisture. Once youve planted and covered your seeds, use a gentle shower from your garden hose to water them be gentle here, you dont want to disturb the seeds or the soil. Keep up the practice of making sure these seeds are watered to ensure healthy germination until you see sprouts. Once the seeds have sprouted, look for them to develop into seedlings. They will start to sprout leaves, and in the case of multiple plants, wait for one of the plants to develop three well defined sets of leaves. Once the third set has developed, then do a little thinning youll want to thin out the smaller, weaker plants so that only the stronger ones are left. This ensures that the smaller plants arent stealing moisture and nutrients from the champions of the batch. Its best, and easiest, to thin while these seedling are small, so that pulling them up doesnt disturb the roots of the stronger plants. Succession planting As a gardener, you may wish to simply garden for a single season: plant, tend, harvest, and then leave the garden beds be until next summer. Thats totally fine, but if youd like a garden that really works for you year-round, consider succession planting. Succession planting isnt difficult, and it will truly maximize the rewards you get from your home vegetable garden. By using succession planting, you could double or triple the volume of fresh vegetables you harvest from your garden. By continuously planting and harvesting each season in spring, Summer, and Fall, with weather-appropriate plants, you can turn your garden into a very efficient food source. Crop rotation Those of us who have been gardening for years all have a story about a bumper crop one year leading to a minuscule harvest the next. Bountiful plants followed by punier versions is a very common tale among gardeners, and the culprit isnt the validity of your (or our) green thumb the answer to fighting this boom-and-slump cycle is crop rotation. Crop rotation is, essentially, an extension of the work you did in initially laying out your garden, and deciding where to plant what. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            "10 Moving the plant groups that you have placed together to new locations and new soil every year is something that some gardeners dont do, but it can be a huge improvement to nearly any garden, in several ways. First of all, rotating crops year after year helps to keep that soil that we spent so much time worrying about healthy and fertile. By planting the same plants in the same soil each year, those same plants are going to drain the same nutrients in the same way year after year, and over time that soil will become less effective. Additionally, rotating your plant groups helps to mitigate soil diseases and pests mainly nematodes. What are those? These are conditions like verticillium wilt and rootworms that prefer certain types of plants so planting the same thing in the same location each year helps them set up a permanent foothold. It is recommended that crop locations are rotated to a different plant family after each planting over two years. Some examples are as follow: Night Shade: Tomato, Eggplant, Pepper Morning Glory: Sweet Potato Legumes-Bean: Long Beans, Wing Beans Maintaining the garden Once youve planted your seeds, its time to get to maintaining those plants. Garden maintenance isnt difficult, it just requires a little attention every day. This is what, for many of us, makes gardening so enjoyable. It gets us out of the house and into the warm sun each day, carefully watching and tending to the plants as we see the fruits sometimes literally of our labor thrive. Watering When, how often, and how much water to give a garden is one of the most common questions beginner gardeners ask. Watering your garden can be as simple as watching rain falls, or as complex as installing automatic irrigation systems. Finding the happy place somewhere in between is where most beginner should flourish. In terms of how much water your garden needs, that really depends on many factors. The plants, your location, the type of soil you have all of these are factors in how much youll need to water your garden. In terms of soil, sandy soils tend to (of course) hold less water than heavier dirt or clay soils. So, consider how long it takes that soil to dry out. This is another reason that soil building with compost or manure is highly recommended this creates healthy soil that drains rainwater sufficiently while retaining just enough water for plants. As a rule of thumb, your garden soil should be just moist. If the weather is rainy, you may not need to add any \n",
            "---------------\n",
            "11 water at all. If its hot and dry, then youll want to bring out the hose. Watering in the morning tends to be best, so that evaporation is reduced, but watering in the afternoon is okay, too. If you water later in the day, try not to let the plants get too wet this can encourage fungal growth if the dampness persists into cool evenings. Weed control Weeds compete for sunlight, water and nutrient. If youve taken steps to prevent weeds when you created your garden, weed control on an ongoing basis should be fairly manageable particularly if youre using raised beds or square-foot gardening methods, which tend to not inherit weeds. Weeds can surprise you even in a weed-free patch of soil, you may find that once you plant, you start seeing weed growth, too. This is because the seeds for those weeds can remain deep under the soil, where they dont get enough sun or moisture to grow, until theyre dredged up toward the surface by your tiller, hoe, or trowel. For this reason, you should keep an eye on your garden for weed growth. When you do see weeds popping up, dont wait for them to become a bigger problem. Young weeds are much easier to deal with than older ones. Once youve pulled them, just toss them on the ground as they decay, they will help add nutrients to your soil. Pest control The best thing you can do for pest control is companion planting, as discussed earlier. Another good practice is to plant flowers in addition to your vegetables this will attract bees and other insects, which will act as natural pest deterrents. Still, even with plenty of preparation, sometimes pests like aphids, corn earworm, leaf footed bug, mites, scale and others will appear. The best pest control method depends on your plants, and the type of pests you have. Few natural pesticides that you can make at home are presented in Annex 2. For advice on pest management contact your Extension Agent Fertilizer So, youve composted and mulched and manured your soil is in tip-top shape. But, as weve mentioned, even manure doesnt have the nutrient content of a good fertilizer, so it may be good to consider using some (especially if you dont use manure). There are 3 major kinds of fertilizer: Organic fertilizers are just what they sound like: theyre made from natural materials, and have to be broken down naturally by microorganisms in your soil, \n",
            "---------------\n",
            "12 resulting in a slow, gradual release of nutrients. Water-soluble fertilizers are mixed with water and sprayed onto soil and plants as a liquid, rapidly feeding nutrients to the plants. Synthetic fertilizers are nutrient-rich chemical compounds that attempt to emulate the effects of organic fertilizers on a more rapid, and more nutrient-rich, basis. Plants get food from the ground, sunlight, air and water. For best growth, plants often need more food than is in the soil, especially after the first crop. They will need another source of food from fertilizer or compost. Harvesting the crops This is the time youve been waiting for! All throughout the season youve weeded, youve watered, youve nurtured and youve fertilized. Now those veggies are ripe, and its harvest time. Here are some tips for harvest time to help you make the most of your home garden. First of all, resist the urge to harvest all in one day. Vegetables ripen at different times, and some plants produce harvestable vegetables continuously for weeks. Make harvesting part of your daily garden routine harvest veggies as they ripen. This ensures that you get a constant supply of fresh, ripe veggies, and it encourages production in the plant (since it isnt wasting energy and nutrients on a vegetable thats already ripe anymore). Always harvest fruits and vegetable when they are ripe do not allow over ripping or rotting, over ripe fruits and vegetable can become breeding places for pests (e.g. fruit flies) Do not allow rotten or bad produce on the ground again this will great breeding places for pests. For leafy vegetables, cut through the whole stalk at an angle harvest these in the cool morning time if you can. For summer squash, you can harvest by holding the vine in one hand while holding the squash in your other hand. A gentle pull is all it takes. In the case of winter squash, cut the vines about 3 inches from the squash. For root vegetables like onions, carrots, and potatoes, loosen the soil around them with a garden fork before pulling you dont want to damage the veggies by trying to pull them through solid soil! If you can, try to leverage the veggies out with the fork after loosening the soil, rather than by pulling alone \n",

            "69 Annex 1: A guide to backyard composting What is Compost? Compost is a natural fertilizer and soil conditioner. You can make it at home from organic materials such as kitchen scraps and garden waste. When put into a pile, these materials naturally decompose, turning into a rich, soil-like material called compost or humus. Composting is basically a way of speeding up the natural process of decomposition. The Keys to Good Compost Balanced diet: For optimal decomposition, the carbonnitrogen ratio in a compost pile should be about 30:1. Carbon-rich (brown) materials include dry leaves, corn stalks, and sawdust. Nitrogen-rich (green) materials include food scraps, coffee grounds, and grass clippings. Temperature: Compost piles are most active at temperatures of 44 to 52 C. Decomposition drops with the ambient temperature, and stops altogether if the pile freezes. Oxygen: Compost depends on the production of aerobic (oxygen-loving) bacteria, which do the work of decomposition. Moisture: Compost should be moist, but not wet-excess water will decrease oxygen levels, slowing down decomposition. Ten Easy Steps to Making Compost 1. Select a site: In a sunny, well-drained location, measure out anarea to site your bin. Three squarefeet is an ideal bin size, and is theminimum size necessary togenerate the required heat in theshortest possible time. 2. Purchase a bin: Contact yourmunicipality, a local store, or buildyour own rodent-proof compostbin. 3. Form base layer: In the bottom ofthe bin, arrange a six-inch layer ofcoarse materials such as sticks,pruning, and bark pieces. This willallow air to filter into the center ofthe heap without smothering thesoil surface. 4. Alternate layers: After the baselayer is formed, you can startusing your compost bin daily. Asyou accumulate kitchen or yardwaste, add it to the bin in layers,starting with 2 to 4 inches ofgreen organic matter. Followthis with more carbon-richbrown matter, and continue toalternate between green andbrown, ensuring that no organiclayer is ever more than 15 inchesdeep. \n",

            "70 5. Moisten: Lightly water the pile ifnecessary-compost ingredientsshould be damp, not soaking. 6. Cover: The compost pile shouldalways be topped by a thickcarbon (brown) layer. Using a lidwill discourage rodents and otheranimals. 7. Monitor: Each time you addmaterial to the bin, give it a lookand a sniff. If the pile has anunpleasant odor, or does notappear to be gradually shrinking,this indicates a problem with thepile. 8. Add more layers: The pile willshrink as its contents decompose;continue adding material. 9. Check: Compost is generally readyto use after about 23 months. This can vary depending on thingslike temperature and the materials used. Once your bin starts to get full, check to see if the bottom portion of the pile is ready to harvest in order to make room at the top. 10. Harvest: Begin harvesting whenthe compost at the bottom andcenter is decomposed. Dig out thecompost with a shovel, using thedoor at the bottom of acommercial bin. If you have builtyour own bin, remove the top newlayers and dig the compost fromthe center.

            "75 Annex 3: Synthetic fertilizers There are 16 main nutrients or elements that plants require for normal growth and development. These nutrients are divided into two main groups, the macro-elements that are required in relatively large quantities and the micro-elements or trace elements, which are required in very small quantities. The macro-elements are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), potassium (K), phosphorous (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S). The trace elements are iron (Fe), copper (Cu), boron (B), molybdenum (Mo), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn). N, P and K are the most well-known elements that plants require, the remaining macro elements (phosphorous (P), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S)) are also important. What follows is a short discussion of the main reasons why each nutrient is important. There is also a discussion on how to identify their deficit. What fertilizer? Nitrogen (N) Why does a plant need N? Nitrogen is essential for the synthesis of proteins in plants. N is necessary as a building block for genetic material. N is an essential part of the green pigment chlorophyll. N is good for leafy vegetables or as a general tonic to boostplant growth. Where do we find N? Plants use nitrogen in two forms, these are ammonium andnitrate Ammonium will stimulate leafy growth. Applying nitrate or urea as a foliar spray very quickly stimulatescrop growth. Nitrogen is also found in organic matter, such as lawn clippings,compost, manure as well as blood or bone meal. N deficiency diagnosis? Plants are stunted Leaves become pale green or yellow (chlorosis) Yellowing is normally seen on older leaves first\n",
            "---------------\n",
            "76 Yellowing starts at the tip of the leaf progressing down themiddle of the leaf to the leaf base, spreading across the leafblade as a whole. What fertilizer? Phosphorus (P) Why does a plant need P? Plants require phosphorous all the time There is a strong relationship between phosphorous andnitrogen requirements If there is no N, the plant cannot take up P from the growthmedium P is essential for growth and development of stems, roots,seeds, flowers and seedlings In crops P improves crop quality, increases root growth andleads to earlier crop maturity. Where do we find P? Phosphorous deficiency can be corrected by addingphosphorus to irrigation water in the form of e.g. potassiumphosphate, or a foliar application of ammonium phosphate. As with nitrogen scorching of leaves could occur A more long-term source of phosphorous is super-phosphatewhich is applied to the soilP deficiency diagnosis? Plants are stunted x Leaves take on a purplish color. The undersides of the leaves become characteristically purpleespecially on the veins. Fruits mature late and seeds do not develop properly The change in color usually develops on older leaves first. What fertilizer? Potassium (K) Why does a plant need K? Makes plant structure Improve plant growth. Aids in the plants overall vigor, strength, water uptake anddisease resistance. K plays a role in maintaining plant water balance, controlstranspiration, and activates enzymes. K improves the plants flower, fruit and seed quality. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            "77 Where do we find K? Potassium deficiency can be overcome by foliar application ofpotassium Sulphate or potassium nitrate. A more long-termsource of potassium is potash worked into the soil. What does a plant that is deficient in K look like? The first sign of potassium deficiency is that the leaves turndark green x In time leaves become a purple brown colour. This discoloration is followed by yellowing of leaf edgesleading to a browning dying off (necrosis) of the tissue. Weak stems, with yellowing or browning around the edgesand tips of older leaves are a tell-tail sign of K deficiency. What fertilizer? Calcium (Ca) Why does a plant need Ca? Calcium is a major constituent of cell walls. Ca is involved in nitrogen metabolism and activates enzymes. Ca helps to build strong stems. Where do we find Ca? The effects of can generally be reversed. This is done by a foliar application of compounds such ascalcium nitrate. Calcium is also found in agricultural lime,super-phosphate and gypsum. What does a plant that is deficient in Ca look like? Common symptoms of calcium deficits are stunting, wiltingand dark green discoloration. Leaf margins become scorched x Roots are poorly developedand the root tips die off. In fruit crops like tomatoes, cucumbers and peppers calciumdeficiency causes blossom end rot. This condition isirreversible. What fertilizer? Magnesium (Mg) Why does a plant need Mg? Magnesium is essential a part of the green pigment chlorophylland is thus an extremely important element. Where do we find Mg? Magnesium deficiency is common and can be corrected byfoliar application of Epson salts. Magnesium is found in anumber of commercial fertilizers. What does a plant that is A plant is deficient in magnesium develops yellow leaves Usually the older leaves of the plant, rather than the newyoung leave develop this symptom. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            "78 deficient in Mg look like? The margins of leaves turn yellow, spreading to the leaf blade as a whole. What fertilizer? Sulphur (S) Why does a plant need S? Sulphur is important for the production of chlorophyll S is also important as a protein constituent. Where do we find S? Mg is found in super phosphate and gypsum. What does a plant that is deficient in S look like? A sulphur deficiency affects the quality and flavour of fruitand vegetables. It is seen as a light purple discoloration of petioles, stemsand veins, with the leaves turning pale yellow. Dead spots and patches may develop on leaves. What fertilizer? Iron (Fe) Why does a plant need Fe? Iron plays a vital role in the formation of chlorophyll duringphotosynthesis. Where do we find Fe? Iron can be applied as iron chelates and iron salts. Deficiency develops if the growth medium pH is too high or ifanaerobic conditions develop in soil or too much magnesiumis found in the in the rooting medium. What does a plant that is deficient in Fe look like? Iron deficiency symptoms are similar to those of magnesium. The major symptoms are yellowing of young developingleaves. The veins remain green but the rest of the tissue becomesyellow, causing a mottled leaf. What fertilizer? Manganese (Mn) Why does a plant need Mn? Mn is Essential for the manufacturing of sugars Mn is required for nitrogen metabolism. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            "79 Where do we find Mn? Manganese can be applied as manganese sulphate Care must be taken however as this element is toxic at highconcentrations. What does a plant that is deficient in Mn look like? Develops first on young tissues and can easily be confused withiron deficiency. The distinguishing factor is that Mn deficits cause more overallleaf discoloration and may also cause necrotic spots andlesions. In severe cases leaves become distorted. What fertilizer? Copper (Cu) Why does a plant need Cu? Plays a role in the activation of several enzymes, effects cellwall formation Plants require very little Cu to be present. Where do we find Cu? Copper deficits can be remedied by the application of coppersulphate. What does a plant that is deficient in Cu look like? Cu deficiency causes stunting of the plants leading toshortened inter-nodes and small leaves. Chlorite blotches develop on older leaves, gradually spreadingto younger leaves. Affected leaves turn dull green to bronze with the edgescurling upwards. \n",

            " 51. GENERAL ASPECTS OF PLANT PRODUCTION 1.1. CLIMATE CONDITIONS Among climate factors, the primary parameters influencing crop growing and development are temperature and precipitation. Minimum daily temperature for measurable growth is usually determined for species but can depend on genotype, e.g. 5 C for wheat and 10 C for maize. Under this value the plants do not show physiological activity. Minimum and optimum temperature for germination/emergence are characteristic values and usually exhibit a significant difference, e.g. 5 C and 20-25 C, respectively for wheat. Temperature regime from germination to ripening is highly genotype dependent. Highest temperature is usually needed in the last stages of ripening. In the case of crops cultivated for their vegetative storage organs (e.g. sugar beet, potato), a high difference between day and night temperatures is needed to lower the rate of dry matter losses caused by respiration. Plants have the highest water requirement in the stages of intensive growing and development, e.g. at stem elongation in small grain cereals. In the case of maize and pulses, however flowering and grain development require the highest amount of water. For some crops such as spring (malting) barley an equilibrated water supply during the growing period is necessary. Regarding water scarcity, not only soil drought but also atmospheric drought can cause severe damages in crop populations. Dry air of ca. 0% humidity stimulates transpiration of plants to extreme rates. Daylength is important especially in the case of plants exhibiting photoperiodism. Long-day plants (e.g. spring barley, pea, lettuce) flower when the day length exceeds the critical photoperiod (ca. 12 hours), while short-day plants (e.g. rice) flower when the day lengths are less than their critical photoperiod. Regarding climatic conditions, overwintering crops, especially winter cereals and rapeseed raise specific aspects. They require a period of exposure to low temperatures (max. 4 C) for a given period (min. 6 weeks) to trigger reproductive development. This process is called vernalization. Furthermore, these crops are exposed to the unfavorable winter climate conditions. The lack of insulation by adequate snow cover could pose a threat to the survival of the crop. Low temperatures kill plants by injuring their crown. Suffocation occurs if ice forms on the soil surface that can cut off the oxygen supply to plants below. Puddling of water also can reduce the oxygen flow to the winter crops. In the case of heaving, freezing and thawing of the soil can lift the plants out of the ground, tearing the roots of the weak individuals. 1.1.1. Test your knowledge List and describe the climate factors being the most important in crop production Give the main aspects regarding tempearature, water and daylength Give the specific concerns regarding winter crops 1.2. SOIL CONDITIONS Soils are made up of four basic components: sand, silt, clay (Figure 1) and organic matter. Organic Matter (OM) is made up of dead and decaying plants, animals and microorganisms. OM is a repository of nutrients that are released into the soil and it decomposes. OM also has a large water holding capacity, which helps retain moisture in soils during times of drought. Primarily organic matter is found at the top and in the uppermost layers of the soil profile, where most root growth occurs. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 6 Sand and silt are broken down bedrock, so they usually reflect the bedrock, or parent material, found below the soil. Sand is the largest soil particle at 0.05 to 2 mm. Anything larger than that is considered to be gravel and stones. Sand, with its large diameter and low surface area to volume ratio, allows water to drain right through and does not have the ability to hold onto many nutrients. Silt is the middle soil particle at 0.002 to 0.05 mm. Silt is commonly found in waterways and floodplains. With some water holding capacity and some nutrient holding capacity, silt is part of a good soil mix with moderate drainage and nutrients. Clay is different from sand and silt in that it is made up of silicon, aluminum, and oxygen. It is the smallest soil particle at 0.002 mm or less and has a very high water holding capacity and a high surface area to volume ratio enabling it to be a very good nutrient holder. Soils that hold water often include a lot of clay, and many plants are specially adapted to live in high clay soils. Figure 1 Percentages of clay, silt and sand in the basic textural classes The ideal soil is considered to be a loam, which is a mix of sand, silt and clay. Loams take advantage of the balance of water holding and nutrient availability between the three. Loamy soils with high organic matter are very well suited for high demand crops such as vegetables and fruit. The rationalized key to the World Reference Base (WRB) Reference Soil Groups (RSGs) is shown in Table 1.

CROP ROTATION AND CROP SEQUENCING Crop rotation means the successive cultivation of different crops in a specified order on the same fields. Some rotations are designed for high immediate returns, with little regard for basic resources. Others are planned for high continuing returns while protecting resources. A typical scheme selects rotation crops from three classifications: cultivated row crops (e.g. maize, potatoe), close-growing grains (e. g., oats, wheat), and sod-forming or rest crops (e.g. clover, clover-timothy). In general, cropping systems should include deep-rooting legumes. In addition to the many beneficial effects on soils and crops, well-planned crop rotations make the farm a more effective year-round enterprise by providing more \n",

Tillage can also mean the land that is tilled. Based on their sequence and role, there are three types of tillage: primary, secondary and tertiary tillage. Tillage classifications Primary tillage: deep tillage operation (>15 cm) that loosens and fractures soil to kill weeds, reduce soil strength, mix residue, lime, fertilizers and manure into soil. Secondary tillage: shallow tillage operation (<15 cm) to kill weeds, cut and cover residues, incorporate herbicides, prepare a pulverized seedbed. Tertiary/cultivating tillage: in crop tillage used to control weeds or inject fertilizers and manure. Classification of principal tillage systems Conventional tillage involves inversion of the soil, normally with a mouldboard or a disc plough as the primary tillage operation, followed by secondary tillage with a disc harrow. The main objective of the primary tillage is weed control through burying, and the main objective of the secondary tillage is to break down the aggregates and to prepare a seedbed. Subsequent weed control may be carried out either mechanically with a cultivator, or with herbicides. The negative aspect of this system is that the soil lacks a protective residue cover and is left practically bare, meaning that it is susceptible to soil and water losses through erosive processes. Conservation tillage is a general term which has been defined as whatever sequence of tillage operations that reduces the losses of soil and water, when compared to conventional tillage. Normally this refers to a tillage system which does not invert the soil and which retains crop residues on the surface. According to another definition, conservation tillage is any kind of tillage or sowing system which maintains at least 30% of the soil surface covered with residues after sowing so as to reduce erosion by water. Conservation tillage includes the following systems: Zero tillage (direct drilling, No Till): seeds are planted into the stubble of the previous crop without any previous tillage or soil disturbance, except that being necessary to place the seed at the desired depth; weed control by the of herbicides Strip tillage or zonal tillage: strips 5 to 20 cm in width are prepared to receive the seed, the soil along the intervening bands is not disturbed and remains covered with residues; more soil disturbance and less cover along the rows compared to zero tillage. Tined tillage or vertical tillage: the land is prepared with implements which do not invert the soil and cause little compaction; the surface remains with a good cover of residues on the surface (>30%); commonly used implements: stubble mulch chisel plough, stubble mulch cultivator, vibro-cultivator Ridge tillage: the system of ridges and furrows; ridges: narrow or wide, furrows: parallel to the contour lines (conserving moisture) or constructed with a slight slope (draining excess moisture.); ridges: semi-permanent or constructed each year, governing the amount of residue material remaining on the surface; semi-permanent systems: good residue cover between ridges, but still more soil disturbance and less overall cover than for the zero tillage system; the system is less conservationist than strip tillage Reduced tillage: the whole soil surface is tilled but one or more of the operations done with a conventional tillage system are eliminated; systems, e.g. disc harrow followed by sowing, chisel plough or cultivator followed by sowing, rotary cultivator followed by sowing \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 12 Classification of systems described above can be occasionally confusing. Reduced tillage can be conservation or non-conservation tillage system, depending on the implements used, on the number of passes, and on the amount of crop residue which remains after the seed has been placed. Thus, only land preparation with the chisel plough or tined cultivator followed by sowing could be classified as a conservation tillage system. Depending on author, minimum tillage can mean conservation tillage, zero tillage or reduced tillage, thus the usage of this term should be avoided. One way to visualize the tillage terminology is to imagine a triangle (Figure 2). Source: Manual on integrated soil managament and conservation practices. FAO, 2000 Figure 2 The tillage triangle The classification of tillage systems can be based parallel on the decision between ploughing and without ploughing, as well as on the handling of stubble (Figure 3). Decision according to the growing conditions and economic possibilities Ploughing-based systems Systems without ploughing Stubble Stubble cleaning (stalk chopping) and disking Direct sowing Ploughing and levelling Primary tillage with subsoiler or cultivator or disk harrow Tillage (whole surface or strip tillage) and sowing and surface closing Traditional method: levelling, seedbed preparation and sowing in separate steps Reduced method: seedbed preparation, sowing and surface closing in one step Traditional sowing and surface closing Figure 3 Main steps of the formation of tillage systems \n",

CROP NUTRITION Essential plant nutrients A total of only 16 elements are essential for the growth and full development of higher green plants according to the criteria laid down by Arnon and Stout (1939). These criteria are: A deficiency of an essential nutrient makes it impossible for the plant to complete the vegetative or reproductive stage of its life cycle. Such deficiency is specific to the element in question and can be prevented or corrected only by supplying this element. The element is involved directly in the nutrition of the plant quite apart from its possible effects in correcting some unfavourable microbiological or chemical condition of the soil or other culture medium. Table 5 Essential plant nutrients, forms taken up and their typical concentration in plants Nutrient (symbol) Essentiality established by Forms absorbed Typical concentration in plant dry matter Macronutrients Nitrogen (N) de Saussure (1804) NH4+, NO3 1.5% Phosphorus (P, P2O51) Sprengel (1839) H2PO4-, HPO42- 0.10.4% Potassium (K, K2O1) Sprengel (1839) K+ 15% Sulphur (S) Salm-Horstmann (1851) SO42- 0.10.4% Calcium (Ca) Sprengel (1839) Ca2+ 0.21.0% Magnesium (Mg) Sprengel (1839) Mg2+ 0.10.4% Micronutrients Boron (B) Warington (1923) H3BO3, H2BO3- 660 g/g (ppm2) Iron (Fe) Gris (1943) Fe2+ 50250. g/g (ppm) Manganese (Mn) McHargue (1922) Mn2+ 20500. g/g (ppm) Copper (Cu) Sommer, Lipman (1931) Cu+, Cu2+ 520. g/g (ppm) Zinc (Zn) Sommer, Lipman (1931) Zn2+ 21150. g/g (ppm) Molybdenum (Mo) Arnon & Stout (1939) MoO42- below 1. g/g (ppm) Chlorine (Cl) Broyer et al., (1954) Cl- 0.22 percent Notes: 1 Oxide forms are used in extension and trade. 2 ppm = parts per million = mg/kg = g/g; 10 000 ppm = 1 percent. Out of these 16 elements, carbon (C) and oxygen are obtained from the gas CO2, and hydrogen (H) is obtained from water (H2O). These three elements are required in large quantities for the production of plant constituents such as cellulose or starch. The other 13 elements are called mineral nutrients because they are taken up in mineral (inorganic) forms. They are traditionally divided into two groups, macronutrients and micronutrients, \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 15according to the amounts required. Regardless of the amount required, physiologically, all of them are equally important. The 13 mineral elements are taken up by plants in specific chemical forms regardless of their source (Table 5). Calculation of crop nutrient requirement The ultimate aim of all aspects of nutrient management is to: optimize crop production, maximize positive interactions, maximize net returns, minimize the depletion of soil nutrients, and minimize nutrient losses or negative impact on the environment. The basic aspects of the effective and up to date crop nutrition practice: nutrition practice of various crops and its method should fit to the soils of the growing area plants should get an amount of nutrient that they need during the vegetation period or that we harvest with the main yield or via by-products (straw, beet-head etc.) uptakable nutrient content of soils should not decrease, and its increase should not reach and exceed a level being harmful for the soil, cultivation status of soil and for environment. Basic steps of calculating nutrient supply for a given crop: 1. Determination of suitability of the soil of the growing area for the chosen crop 2. The nutrient status of the growing area (according to soil categories) 3. The N, P2O5 and K2O amount taken up by 1 ton yield (together with the harvested byproduct) of the planned crop 4. Planning the possible amount of yield per ha for the given crop 5. Based on the nutrient supply data of the given growing area, calculation of the amount of N, P2O5 and K2O needed for 1 ton yield 6. Considering the calculated yield, the amount of N, P2O5 and K2O needed for 1 ha 7. Converting calculation of nutrients for fertilizer, manure or for their combination General application order of fertilizers Traditionally, it is recommended that 1/3 2/3 of the nitrogen, ca. 100% of phosphate (P2O5) and ca. 100% of potash (K2O) be broadcasted and incorporated before planting, usually in late summer or autumn. The remaining nitrogen, phosphate, and potash are to be applied with the seed at planting (in spring). Mineral fertilizer applications should be significantly reduced when manure is also used. Soil test results may indicate that supplemental applications of Ca and Mg are required. Limestone is an excellent source of Ca and Mg, however, if no change in pH is required, gypsum (CaSO4) can be used for Ca and supplemental fertilizer Mg can be used. According to the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) related to soil, fertilizers must be applied at appropriate moments and in adequate doses (i.e., when the plant needs the fertilizer), to avoid run-off. It refers primarily to the nitrate sensitive/vulnerable zones. Fertilizers Nitrogen fertilization: application in the autumn or late summer: usually only after certain forecrops (e.g. lots of stem and root residues), max. 1/3 of the calculated dose for spring crops: into seed bed (can be supplemented with top-dressing, foliage-dressing) for winter crops: late winter - early spring (can be supplemented with top-dressing, foliage-dressing) fertilizer materials (N%): calcium ammonium nitrate (27%), ammonium nitrate (34%), urea (46%), anhydrous ammonia (82%), etc. \n",

SOWING Sowing Placing seeds (or fruits, e.g. cariopses of grasses) of generatively propagated crops into the seed bed. Planting Placing vegetative parts of vegetatively propagated crops in the laid out field, e.g. potato tubers. Transplanting Raising seedlings on nursery beds and transplanting seedlings in the laid out field. The aim: shorten the vegetation period on the field (usually at crops demanding warm climate and/or having long vegetation period). Transplanting can also be the part of protected growing of horticultural crops (e.g. cultivating pepper, tomato, cucumber in greenhouse). Sowing/seeding methods Broadcast seeding Seeds are scaterred by hand or mechanically (e.g. fertilizer spreader) over a relatively large area. Seeds are incorporated by light tillage. Application: - by technology, e.g. alfalfa, clovers, cover crops, lawns, erosion control - by need, in the case of unsuitable weather or soil conditions, e.g. in small grain cereals Problem: seeds are distributed unevenly, not all the seeds are sown at the correct depth Drilling (line sowing) Seeds are sown into rows by a drill, at the correct depth and immediately covered. Drilling is usually followed by rolling to consolidate soil and improve germination. Classification of drilling methods - according to row distance: tight row distance (6-8 cm), e.g. fibre crops (not common) dense row distance (10.5 12 15.2 cm), e.g. small grain cereals (cereal row distance = 12 cm), rapeseed, peas, etc. broad row distance (45 90 cm) at row crops e.g. sugar beet (45 cm); beans, sorghum (50 cm); maise, sunflower, potato (70 76.2 cm); tobacco (90 cm) - sowing with tramlines: according to the track and the wheel width of the machines, 2 x 2-3 rows are left out (the lines are usually ca. 30 cm wide and 2 metres apart while the distance between tramlines can vary from 12 metres to 30 metres) - precision seed drilling (e.g. row crops): seeds are sown at a given plan-to-plant distance - twin-row seeding, strip sowing: rows close together alternate with wide interrow spaces, e.g. 40 cm + 100 cm (e.g. field vegetables) \n",

Test your knowledge Give examples for timing and implements of harvesting 1.10. PRECISION FARMING Precision farming or precision agriculture is an agricultural concept relying on the existence of in-field variability. It requires the use of new technologies, such as global positioning (GPS), sensors, satellites or aerial images, and information management tools (GIS) to assess and understand variations. Collected information may be used to more precisely evaluate optimum sowing density, estimate fertilizers and other inputs needs, and to more accurately predict crop yields. It seeks to avoid applying inflexible practices to a crop, regardless of local soil/climate conditions, and may help to better assess local situations of disease or lodging. Aspects of soil science and agricultural chemistry Application of Global Position System (GPS) helps: - to treat earlier information about the given field (e.g yield map, soil map, area damaged by pathogens, pests and weeds, the rate of damage) in a uniform system and to perform treatments (fertilization, plant protection etc.) in a site-specific manner. Basic elements of a positioning-based production: - yield map: it shows the common effect of many, in lots of cases indepent factors (e.g. effects of diseases, pests, weeds, technological failures) Essential: - preparation of field maps, building a GIS-based geoinformatical system,, division of the field into homogenous parts of easy-to-handle size - the patches can be identified by GPS, equipments mounted ont he machines can recognize them, the doses can be changed and set for the current, local conditions. \n",

            " 22 Aspects of water management Water is (and will be) one of the determining factors in the development of agriculture and environmental protection. Thus, to increase the efficiency of water usage, the regulation of water regime of soils is an exceptional key task. Due to the restricted possibilities of the regulation of the water management in the soil (irrigation, drainage) one of the most progressive solutions is the site-specific regulation of soil moisture content in the frame of precision farming. Basic factors of the water regime of soil are the structure of the soil section, succession and thickness of layers between soil surface and the level of ground water (water table), moisture content, chemical composition of soil moisture, its vertical and horizontal movement etc. To make a scientifically reliable interference possible, exact and quantitative data about these factors, and about the evaluation of their probability and frequency are required. Aspects of plant production Almost all components of production technology can be related with precision solutions: - Tillage (according to the forecrop, to the structure and status of soil and to its suitability for cultivation) - Nutrient supply (depending on the nutrient status of the given soil point, and on the current state of development of the plant population) - Water supply (according to the correspondence between water supplying ability of soil and water requirement of the crop) - Sowing (site- and species/variety-specific plant density, row distance, sowing depth) - Crop care (technological interventions based on field status surveys) - Plant protection (development of methods of integrated prophylactic and symptomatic treatments applied against pests, pathogens and weeds) - Harvesting (adaptation to inhomogenities in the ripening conditions) Aspects of plant protection One of the big contradictions of the conventional plant protection practice is that the distribution of pests on the field is inhomogenous while treatments are planned and performed in a homogenous way. The negative consequence of this contradiction is the pesticide input in excess which is not desired neither from economical nor from environmental protectional point of view. The two main fields of plant protection where techniques of precision farming can be involved: - Determination of temporal and spatial details of preventive protection methods. It has the primary importance in protection against pathogens and animal pest as well as in preemergent weed control. - Postemergent weed control and decision making based on the characterization of symptoms to prevent the escalation of an epidemics in the presence of the pest These two main directions of development require different solutions. In the first case, traditional equipments and theoretical models stay in use by pest forecasting but data are processed by computer based simulation models and algorithms. In the second case, the newest developments of precision farming should be applied. 1.10.1.

            " 252.1. CEREALS Common feature of cereals is the seed (kernel) of high starch (flour) content. Most of them belong to Gramineae. 2.1.1. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Wheat is the largest arable crop in the world regarding its growing area (215,489,485 ha). Its global production is 670,875,110 tons (FAO, 2012). Wheat can be utilized several ways for food (e.g. flour, semolina, groats, bread, pastas, doughs, biscuits, vital glutene, flakes, bran), feed (e.g. grain, forage, forage-mixes: wheat and Pannon vetch mix, wheat and autumn pea, Legny-mix). Its by-product is straw that can be used as litter as well as for energy and bio-fuel production. 100 g of hard red winter wheat contains about 12.6 g of protein, 1.5 g of total fat, 71 g of carbohydrate, 12.2 g of dietary fiber, and 3.2 mg of iron. Compared to other cereals, it contains higher leves of P, Zn, Cu, Mn, Se, vitamin B3, vitamin E Wheat varieties can be classified in terms of: growing season (winter wheat or spring wheat), maturity (early, medium, medium-late, late), ecotype (wheat of humid climate, steppe-type, desert or semi-desert type, uplands), seed color and seed hardness (hard red winter wheat, soft red winter wheat, hard red spring wheat, white wheat). Figure 6 Wheat: awnless (left) and awned (centre) genotype, demonstration plot (right) Botanical characteristics Wheat and other small grain cereals has two types of roots, the seminal roots (one primary root and 4-6 lateral seminal roots) and the nodal roots (adventitious or crown roots), which arise from the lower nodes of the shoot. Shoots (straw) are made up of internodes (6-16/shoot) separated by nodes. Straw is usually hollow but it can also be thick-walled and solid. Wheat plants are usually 90-100 cm tall depending on genotype. Tillers having the same basic structure as the main shoot, arise from the axils of the basal leaves. A leaf is inserted at each node of the stem, the uppermost leaf being called flag leaf. Leaves have three parts: leaf sheath, leaf blade and ligule. Auricles are appendages at the base of the leaf blade. Their size is characteristic for the species - in the order of decreasing size: barley, wheat (often hairy), rye, oat (no auricle). Leaves, stem and inflorescence can possess a coat of wax depending on variety and environment. The inflorescence of wheat is a spike (ear or head) composed of ca. 20 spikelets that are alternately arranged on the rachis. Spikelets have two glumes that enclose two to eight florets (usually up to 5 fertile). \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 26 The outer parts of each floret consist of a lemma and a palea. The floret is composed of two lodiculas, three stamens with anthers, ovary with a hairy stigma of two arms. According to awnedness (awns are on lemmas) awnless, apically awnletted, awnletted and awned spikes can be distinguished (Figure 6). The spike shape can be tapering, oblong, clavate or fusiform. Spike attitudes at maturity range erect (upright to 30), semi-erect, inclined (30 to 90), horizontal, semi-nodding and nodding (>90). The grain (kernel or caryopsis) is a complete fruit developing from one floret. It has a pericarp of the fruit fused with the seed coat, typical of the grasses, and the entire kernel is can be referred to as the seed. It is usually oval but it can range from almost spherical to long, narrow and flattened. Its color is red (brownish) or white (yellowish). Kernels of small grain cereals have a crease on the ventral side, hairy structures (brush) on the distal end and the germ on the lower end. Kernels are coated by several layers of tissues (the bran): epidermis, hypodermis, cross cells, tube cells, seed coat, nuclear tissue (hyaluron), aleurone cells. Aleurone cells build the outer layer of endosperm and contain enzymes (hydrolases) that take part in the decomposition of storage nutrient during germination. Endosperm fills out the center of the grain. Its cells contain granules of starch surrounded by a clear glassy protein. Thousand kernel weight of wheat is 40-44 g. Its centers of origin are the Fertile Crescent and Southwest Asia, as well as the Caucasus, Afghanistan, Iran and Asia Minor. Triticum spp. belong to the family Gramineae/Poaceae. T. aestivum is an amphidiploid/allohexaploid (AABBDD, 2n=42) of T. urartu/boeticum (AA, 2n=14), (supposed) T. speltoides/searsii (BB, 2n=14) and Aegylops squarrosa (syn, T. tauschii; DD, 2n=14). T. spelta is also allohexaploid, T. durum and T. dicoccum are tetraploid lacking the D-genome. T. monococcum is diploid (2n=14), containing the A-genome. According to the extended BBCH-scale, wheat and other small grain cereals have the following principal phenological growth stages: 0: Germination 1: Leaf development 2: Tillering 3: Stem elongation 4: Booting 5: Inflorescence emergence, heading 6: Flowering, anthesis 7: Development of fruit 8: Ripening 9: Senescence Winter wheat usually starts tillering in the autumn and continues in the spring. Winter wheats require a period of exposure to low temperatures (max. 4 C) for a given period (min. 6 weeks) to trigger its reproductive development. This process is called vernalization. Flowering of spikes (anther visible on the spike surface) starts in the middle flowers and extends towards the ends. Wheat is self-pollinated, cross pollination can occur depending on genotype and/or climate up to 10%. Environmental requirements Wheat is cultivated worldwide from subarctic to tropical areas and up to above 1500 m of altitudes. The growing period ranges from 180 to 280 days for winter wheat and from 100 to 130 days for spring wheat. Minimum daily temperature for measurable growth is about 5 C, however germination starts at ca. 3-4 C (optimum: 18-25 C). Winter wheat in its early developmental stages is resistant to frost down to -20 C. This resistance is lost in the \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 27active growth period in spring. Frost during head development and flowering periods can cause head sterility. Mean daily temperature for optimum growth is 15-20 C. Extreme high temperature and drought in the early stages of fruit development can lead to forced ripening, incomplete grain filling and to the formation of poor quality shrivelled grains of low 1000 kernel weight. For last stages of ripening a dry, warm period of 18 C or more is preferred. Precipitation in this period causes delayed harvesting and decrease in quality (e.g. low falling number). Wheat grown under temperate climate requires 450-650 mm precipitation in the growing period. Growth stages of highest water requirement are stem elongation, grain filling and germination. Wheat can be grown on a wide range of soils. Most preffered are soils of deep fertile surface layer (tilth) that are rich in nutrients, exhibit a good water supply and have a medium texture. The optimum pH ranges from 6 to 8. Soils of shallow surface layer, eroded soils, loose sand, extreme hard soils and peaty soils should be avoided. Wheat is relatively tolerant to a high groundwater table. Cultivation Wheat, especially winter wheat, has special requirements regarding forecrops. It prefers early harvested forecrops that does not exploit water and nutrient content of soil and leave it in good condition without weeds. Best forecrops are pulses (except for soybean), legumes, winter and spring forage mixes, rapes, flax, hemp, tobacco, early potato, sweet corn, field vegetables, herbs, etc. Forecrops of medium quality are early grain corn, sunflower, sugar beet, small grain cereals, etc. Forecrops harvested late (after the end of September) such as corn, sunflower and especially sorghums, should be possibly avoided, especially for winter wheat. Wheat can be sown after wheat maximum once.

            " 28 harrow or ground roll with grain residues. After forecrops leaving high amounts of stem residues, stem chopping is the first step. This case, tillage method requires 22-25 cm deep ploughing closed with a rolling harrow or ground roll. Seedbed is usually prepared by a combinatory. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 7 and 8, respectively. In general, the effective ingredient dose is 200-260 kg/ha NPK (2:1:1). In given conditions, for good yields up to 150 kg/ha N, 35 to 45 kg/ha P and 25 to 50 kg/ha K are recommended. In several countries small grain cereals are advised to be sown in winter at 18 cm and 10 cm in spring. Row distances of 25 and 36 cm are also applied in a number of countries. Target plant population is usually lower (3.5-4.5 million/ha for winter, 3.0-4.0 million/ha for spring wheat). In the UK, optimum plant population of as low as 600,000-1,600,000 plants/ha has been determined, depending on sowing date. Based on the amazing capacity of wheat to produce tillers, declined shoot number does not result in decreased yield due to the larger individual shoots (larger green area), larger spikes (more grains per ear) and larger grains (increased 1000 grain weight). In winter wheat the braking of ice layer by a tractor or roller, the rolling of fields at the end of winter to prevent negative effects of freeze-thaw cycles of soils, the drainage of fields to overcome inundation (and waterlogging) may be necessary. The application of plant growth regulators, usually at the end of tillering, shortens stem height, increases stem thickness thus preventing lodging and increasing yield potential. However, application of regulators is relatively expensive and it belongs to the intensive technologies usually in seed production.

Rye has a slowly decreasing growing area of 5,564,996 ha in the world with a global production of 14,562,055 tons (FAO, 2012). Rye is grown as a grain, as a forage crop aas well as a cover and green manure crop. For human consumption purposes rye grain is used for flour, rye bread, rye beer, crisp bread, whiskey, vodka. As animal feed it is utilized as grain forage or pasture. Rye has a beneficial physiological effect and composition. It has a high dietary fibre and ash content. The high percentage of complex carbohydrates is digested more slowly than simple carbohydrates, and they are less likely to be converted to fat. It has a relatively high Mg, K, vitamin B1 and vitamin B2 content. It has a lower protein content compared to wheat but a more favorable aminoacid composition (e.g. high lysine content). Botanical characteristics Basic characteristics are the same as mentioned at wheat. Its root system is stronger with more nodal roots and reaches a bigger depth. It is the basis of the excellent adaptability of traditional (tall) rye cultivars. Intensive genotypes of shorter stem have a less extended root system and lower capability for adaptation. Traditional cultivars are tall, up to 2 m or more. Stem and leaves of mature plants exhibit a typical bluish, blue-greyish color (Figure 10). Purple or red color occurring mainly on nodules and awns is caused by anthocianins and can be characteristic for given genotypes. The inflorescence is a usually lax, slender, 10-15 cm long spike. The spikelets contain three florets, with the two outer florets being fertile. Like in wheat, the lemma and palea enclosing the floret are free-threshing. Glumes are narrow and open, the lemmas being longer than glumes, taper gradually and often bear barbs on the keel and awns. The kernels are longer and more slender than those of wheat. They have a typical greenish grey color due to lack of complete decomposition of chlorophyll during ripening. The 1000 kernel weight is 30-35 g. \n",

            " 31 Figure 10 Rye Rye starts intensive tillering early and it is finished mainly in autumn. Rye is largely cross-pollinated, as most rye plants are self-sterile, and characteristically some florets fail to set seed. Rye seeds are still physiologically active at harvesting, they lack dormancy. Its center of origin is Southwest Asia (same as for wheat). Annual wild rye (S. silvestre) originates from perennial Anatolian mountain rye (S. monatum). Wild rye was spread as the weed of wheat. It spontaneously crossed with other rye species leading to the generation of cultivated rye. Rye belongs to the family Gramineae/Poaceae. S. cereale is diploid (2n=14), containing the R-genome. Besides varieties, hybrid rye is also grown extensively. Environmental requirements Rye prefers cool and humid climate but it has an extreme adabtibility. It tolerates drought, cold winter and long snow cover. The growing period ranges from 260 to 280 days. Its germination starts at just above 0 C (optimum: 18-25 C). For its quick development a mild and rainy autumn and a long, cool spring is preferred. A humid May and a cool June is beneficial for perfect development of grains. Late-spring frost, cold and stormy weather during flowering result in fertilization defects, in partially fertilized spikes. Growth stages of highest water requirement are stem elongation, grain filling and germination. Rye grows well in much poorer soils compared to other small grain cereals. It is an especially valuable crop in regions where the soil contains sand or peat. On soils of better quality (especially higher humus content) wheat and other cereals give better yield, furthermore rye becomes more susceptible to lodging.

It can be grown even in monoculture for several years but rotation is an effective method of prevention against several pests. Best forecrops are all those harvested early, e.g. potato, yellow lupin (on acidic sand), sweet clover (on alkaline sand), tobacco, oilseed radish. In the course of soil \n",

Diseases and pest are basically the same listed for wheat. Rye is, however, highly susceptible to the ergot (Claviceps purpurea). Harvesting Rye is harvested by a combine in fully ripe stage at moisture content below 16%. Grain loss must be below 4%. Rye lacks dormancy thus preharvest sprouting can happen under humid ripening period. Due to long enzyme activity, rye grains must be regularly mixed and aerated during storage to control temperature to avoid moisture buildup. It can be stored at a maximum of 14% water content. Grain:straw proportion is 1:1.5-1.7. Its average yield is 2-3.5 tons/ha. 2.1.3. Triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack) Triticale is a stable hybrid of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale). The basic aim of its production was to combine yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance of rye. Wheat is the female, rye is the male parent at crossing. Due to the sterility of the hybrid, usually colchicine is needed to induce polyploidy and reach fertility. Originally allooctoploid triticales were grown but their unfavorable characteristics (e.g. yield stability) could be avoided by allohexaploid triticales where tetraploid wheat species (e.g. T. durum) are applied as female parent. Triticale had a growing area of 3,691,578 ha and a global production of 13,671,027 tons in the world (FAO, 2012). Triticale is primarily used as feed grain but it has a potential in the production of products for human consumption, such as flour, bread, as well as energy and biomass crop. Triticale has a remarkably high Mg, K, P, S, Ca, Mn, Zn, Fe, Se content. Its protein content is 12-16%, usually higher than that of wheat with low gluten proportion. The amino acid composition is good, e.g. lysine content is high. Botanical characteristics Morphologically triticale resembles its wheat parent, but partially exhibits the more vigorous growth characteristics of rye. Its root system development and plant height is between those of the parent species, and it tends to tiller less than wheat. The triticale spike resembles that of wheat more than rye, and is often larger than that of the parents. The \n",

The lemmas generally taper into an awn of variable length. It is a self pollinating species but depending on the genotype, it is more susceptible to out-crossing compared to wheat. Its grains are usually brownish in color and slightly wrinkled in appearance. Its 1000 kernel weight is 40-45 g. Figure 11 Triticale Environmental requirements Triticale prefers cool and humid climate but it has a good adabtibility: it can be grown under conditions suitable for wheat or rye. Regarding optimal growing conditions, it is between wheat and rye. At ripening it requires moderate warm conditions. Earlier cultivars were grown on poor sandy soils due to their long stem but current varieties can be grown on soils of better quality without facing the problem of lodging. In general, it is worth cultivating under conditions resulting in more economical yield compared to wheat. These are the less favorable wheat soils that are, however, of better quality compared to those tolerated by rye, e.g. brown forest soils, medium-compact, meliorated meadow soils, sandy soils, alkaline soils, etc. Table 11 Nutrient requirement of triticale Nutrient uptake to 1 ton of grain N: 27 kg/t P2O5: 12 kg/t K2O: 24 kg/t CaO: 7 kg/t MgO: 2 kg/t Table 12 Sowing data of triticale Sowing date: - winter wheat - spring wheat 15.

Best forecrops are all those harvested early (see rye). Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 11 and 12, respectively. In general, the effective ingredient doses are 100-130 kg/ha N, 70-80 kg/ha P and 80-100 kg/ha K. Tillage and crop care have the same aspects as listed for wheat. Diseases and pest Diseases and pest are basically the same listed for wheat and rye. Harvesting Triticale is harvested by a combine in fully ripe stage at moisture content below 16%. Grain loss must be below 4%. Triticale may be difficult to thresh due to its hard hulls. Its average garin yield is 3-6 tons/ha. 2.1.4. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) Barley is the fourth largest cereal in the world regarding its growing area (49,525,988 ha). Due to its adaptability and the growing period of spring barley being the shortest among cereals, barley is cultivated worldwide. In northern countries (to the 70th latitude) this is the only cereal still ripening. It can be cultivated to altitudes of 1900 m (Alps) and 4000 m (Tibet). It is a widely used grain forage in subtropical countries. Agrotechnical advantages of barley are that it tolerates poor soil, small grain cereal forecrop and drought; it is excellent forecrop due to its early harvest; it utilizes nitrogen well, it has a low nitrogen requirement, shallow tillage is sufficient thus cost of production is low. Its global production is 132,886,519 tons (FAO, 2012). Barley is used for the feeding of (primarily monogastric) livestock as grain forage (e.g. for pigs), the whole crop (in dough stage) as silage or dried, ground and granulated (GPS method), as well as its straw. In human consumption it is used as muesli, hulled barley, pearl barley and malt for beer and certain distilled beverages. Two-row barley has a lower protein content than six-row barley, thus possesses a more fermentable sugar content. Barley of high protein content is best suited for animal feed. Malting barley is usually low protein ('low grain nitrogen') showing more uniform germination, needing shorter steeping, and having less protein in the extract. Two-row barley is traditionally used in English ale-style beers and preferred for traditional German beers. Six-row barley is common in lager-style beers, especially when adjuncts (e.g. corn, rice) are used. Barley has a high row fibre content (6, 4.5 and 1.3% for winter, spring and naked barley, respectively) which has a beneficial effect on the fat content of milk. For pig raising and human consumption (naked or dehulled) barley of lower fibre content is preferred. Crude protein content is 12-13.5%. Its lysine content (3.7%) is higher than that of wheat (2.8%). Botanical characteristics Basic characteristics are the same as mentioned at wheat. It has more seminal lateral roots and, according to the more intensive tillering, a higher number of nodal roots. Winter barley has a height similar to that of wheat while spring barley is 20-30 cm shorter with fewer tillers. Barley stems tend to be relatively weak that frequently leads to lodging in the last period of ripening, especially on the effect of heavy rain and storm. Especially prior to stem emergence, barley population shows a yellowish green color compared to the green color of wheat and rye. Considering spike structure, there are two main types of cultivated \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 35barley: two-row and six-row. Both have three spikelets at each rachis node (one central and two laterals), each spikelet containing one floret. Lateral spikelets of two-rowed barley are sterile, resulting in two rows of (the central) kernels on the rachis. Six-rowed barley has all florets being fertile, resulting in six rows of kernels. Depending on genotype, lateral florets can be positioned the way that viewed in cross section only four rows can be seen (Figures 12-13). Awns may be smooth or barbed, longer or shorter relative to ear length. There also exist awnless geotypes, usually cultivated for geen fodder purposes. Cultivated barley species are stricktly self-pollinating. The lemma and palea adhere to the caryopsis in the case of hulled varietes. Hulles barley is \"naked\". Its seeds are released easily from the lemma and palea on threshing. Central kernels of six-row varieties are slightly larger and plumper than the lateral kernels, while those of the two-row varieties are all uniform in shape and size. The 1000 kernel weight is 38-42 g, 15-25% of this being hull. Its center of origin is the Fertile Crescent and Western Asia, the secondary centre of origin being Northeastern Africa. Barley belongs to the family Gramineae/Poaceae and it is diploid (2n=14). Figure 12 Barley: 6-rowed (left), 2-rowed (right) Environmental requirements Winter barley Winter barley is the crop of temperate climate, its growing period ranges from 250 to 270 days. It is less winterhardy than winter wheat, triticale or rye. Severe damages can be caused by a long and cold (-15 C) winter without snow cover, a strong fall in temperature following a warm period and an enduring snow cover. Winter barley has a moderate water requirement similar to that of wheat, however barley tolerates soil drought better than wheat. Precipitation in the period of germination and emergence has a significant importance in the determination of yield. Winter barley tolerates dry spring better than spring barley because it is harvested earlier thus the frightening of drought is lower. Dry March and April, however, can prolong stem elongation. Extreme precipitation in May can result in lodging and yield losses. Conditions making plants susceptible for frost damages and suffocation - such as wet soil, N-overdosage, frost-risk territories, shallow sowing depth, early sowing - should be avoided. Winter barley is the crop of wheat soils of poorer quality. The best are the sandy, loose medium-compact meadow loam soils. It has a pH optimum of ca. 6. It can be grown on a wide range of soils, e.g. medium-compact or loose meadow and forest soils, good quality \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 36 sand, improved alkaline soils, moderately sloping and eroded soils. Wet, compact, cold soils, drift in sand, floodplains should be avoided. Spring barley Spring barley, especially if produced for malting purposes, prefers cool and humid climate. Its growing period is the shortest among small grain cereals ranging from 120 to 150 days. Required effective heat unit is 1300-1800 C. Its germination starts at 1-3 C. A gradual increase in temperature is preferred until reaching a moderate peak of 18-20 C at ripening. If malting barley is produced, higher heat unit and higher temperature at ripening results in a decreased malting quality. It needs an annual precipitation of 550-600 mm, with 200-300 mm in the growing period. An even distribution of precipitation (ca. 40 mm/month) over the whole growing period is necessary with maximums in May and June (50-60 mm/month). Spring barley is a long-day plant thus early sowing is essential. Figure 13 Barley populations: 6-rowed (left), 2-rowed (right) Spring barley requires soils which make an early sowing possible.

In Western Europe it is cultivated on soils of best quality optimal for sugar beet. Acidic soils resulting in decreased yield and poor malting quality (thick hulls, less extract, etc.) must be avoided or improved by lime.

Best forecrops are all those harvested early, e.g. pea, rapeseed, flax, hemp, early potato. Winter barley itself is an excellent forecrop due to its early harvesting. It is good especially before rapeseed, catch crops (e.g. summer sown potato, sweet corn, green bean, forage rape, sudangrass, proso millet, buckwheat, foxtail millet) and green manure crops (e.g. oilseed raddish, lupins, mustard). Tillage and crop care have the same aspects as listed for wheat. Seed bed (8-10 cm depth) should be composed of small soil particles (<5 mm) and prepared 8-10 days prior to sowing to allow sedimentation. Root bed (below seed bed) should have a coarser structure composed of small clods that provides an appropriate pore volume. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 13 and 14, respectively. In general, the effective ingredient doses are 100-120 kg/ha N, 80-100 kg/ha P and 100-140 kg/ha K. Winter barley must not be sown too early to avoid suffocation damages and the late swarming of aphids as virus vectors. In several countries seeding rates of 2.5-3.5 million/ha are applied. Spring barley Best forecrops of spring barley are all those harvested early (e.g. flax, poppyseed, rapeseed, hemp, tobacco, early corn). Malting barley has special requirements. Best forecrop is sugar beet: it requires soil of good quality, does not increase soil N-content, leaves soil in good condition, free of weeds. Potato and silage maize are also preffered: no increase in N, early harvesting, little plant residues, no common pests and diseases. Crops \n",

Grain loss must be below 4-5%. The average yield is 4-5 (up to 7) tons/ha, with lower values for spring barley. Barley can be stored at a maximum of 14-14.5% water content. On drying malting barley, drying temperature must not exceed 40 C. In the malting barley crude protein of 10.6-11.6% (most countries) or 10.0-10.9% (UK) is required to achieve the malt specification for most brewers needs. To realize good malting by plump, even sized kernels covered by an even husk without gape or splitting, the standard is 90% retained over a 2.5 mm screen (most countries) and 94% retained over a 2.25 mm screen (England and Wales). 2.1.5. Oat (Avena sativa L., Avena nuda L.) Oat has a growing are of 9,608,318 ha and a global production of 21,062,972 tons in the world (FAO, 2012). As livestock feed, it can be grain forage for horses and breeding animals, green forage (often as forage mix with e.g. spring vetch) or silage. It is suitable for grazing, furthermore its straw in whole or as flour, mixed with legumes. For human consumption, oat is primarily used as muesli, oatmeal and rolled oat. Oat is considered to be a health food, recently due to its cholesterol-lowering properties. It has the highest content of soluble fibres among cereals resulting in slower digestion and an extended sensation of fullness. Beta-glucan, one type of soluble fibres can lower cholesterol content. Oat has high raw protein content (12-14%) with high avenalin and avenin proportion as well as beneficial amino acid composition. Oat protein is nearly equivalent in quality to soy protein. Oat has a high vitamin E and vitamin B1 (also B2 and B6) content. It has the highest lipid content (5-7%) of cereals, except for maize. It has high metabolizable and digestable energy content. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 39Botanical characteristics Basic characteristics besides inflorescence are the same as mentioned at wheat. It has a well-developed root system exhibiting the highest absorbtion capacity among small-grain cereals. Oats has a height similar to that of wheat. Unlike other small-grain cereals, oats has an inflorescence called panicle (Figure 14). The shape of the panicle can be equilateral or unilateral. Both the main axis and the alternate groups of branches arising from that terminate in a single spikelet. The number of spikelets per panicle ranges from 25 to 45 depending on genotype and growing conditions. Each spikelet contains from one to three (A. sativa) or up to eight (A. nuda) florets enclosed in glumes. Usually only the two basal florets are fertile. The flower is perfect with three stamens, a pistil and 2 lodicules. It is enclosed by two bracts, the lemma and palea. Flowering of oats starts in the uppermost flowers and extends downwards, from the outer florets inwards. The ripening of seeds is less equilibrated compared to spike. Similarly to barley, oats can be hulled (A. sativa) or hulless (A. nuda). The 1000 kernel weight is 28-32 g, 15-25% of this being hull. The center of origin of oats is the Fertile Crescent, Asia Minor and the Mediterranean region. Oats belong to the family Gramineae/Poaceae. Cultivated oats are allohexaploid (2n=42). Figure 14 Oat Environmental requirements Oat is widely grown in temperate and sub-tropical regions but can also be cultivated in the high-altitude tropics. It prefers cool, moist climates, yet it is adapted to many climatic extremes. Oat is susceptible to damage by hot, dry weather if occurring during reproduction. The best areas for oat production have relatively cool summers. Its growing period is the longest among spring small grain cereals ranging from 160 to 180 days. Required effective heat unit is 1300-1800 C. Its germination starts at 1-2 C. In this period it has a frost tolerance to -5 C. A gradual increase in temperature is preferred until reaching a moderate peak of 18-20 C at ripening. It needs 250-300 mm precipitation with even distribution over the whole growing period. Appropriate amount of precipitation in the early stages is essential for a good yield. Precipitation in the later stages is, however, unfavorable due to promoting the development of secondary panicles that prolongs ripening and results in the loosening of grains in the primary panicles. Drought is the most dangerous during panicle development and grain filling. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 40 Oat can be grown on most of the agricultural soils, except for the extreme poor ones. While responding to high fertility, oat will produce a crop on soils too poor and acid for wheat. Oat is less sensible for the raw soils brought to the surface via deepening tillage. Best soils are the moderately acidic (pH 5.3-6.4), medium compact soil of good water management such as cernozem and brown forest soils. Extreme compact, cold, alkaline and very loose sandy soil threatened by deflation should be avoided.

Best forecrops of spring barley are all those harvested early (e.g. rapeseed, pulses, flax). Unfavorable are forecrops spreading common pests and pathogens, having high water and nutrient demands (e.g. small grain cereals, tobacco, potato, vegetables). Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 15 and 16, respectively. In general, the effective ingredient doses are 60-70 kg/ha N, 40-50 kg/ha P and 120-140 kg/ha K.

            " 41seeds in the lower part are in physiological ripening, exhibiting 2-3% higher moisture content. Its average yield is 2.5-5 tons/ha. Due to its high lipid content (5-7%), the waterloss after harvesting is slow. To avoid moisture buildup, grains must be regularly mixed and aerated during storage. Grain:straw proportion is 1:1.5-2.0. 2.1.6. Maize/Corn (Zea mays L.) Maize is the second largest arable crop in the world regarding its growing area (177,379,507 ha plus 1,125,916 ha green maize). Its global production was 872,066,770 tons plus 9,764,006 tons for green maize (FAO, 2012). Maize can be utilized several ways for feed (e.g. grain, silage, Corn-Cob Mix /CCM/, Ground Ear Maize /GEM/), food (e.g. baby corn, sweet corn, popcorn, cornflakes, flour, starch, cooking oil, syrup, alcohol) and other purposes (e.g. bioethanol, biomass-biogas). Maize has a high starch content (65%) while it contains relatively low levels of crude protein (7-9%). The amino acid composition is less favorable compared to several other cereals. Its germ contains 3-5% valuable oil. Botanical characteristics The root system of maize can be divided into embryonic and postembryonic roots. The embryonic root system consists of a primary root and a various number of seminal roots. The postembryonic root system is composed of shoot borne roots formed at consecutive shoot nodes (including aboveground brace roots) and lateral roots initiated at the pericycle of all roots. Maize stems are erect, conventionally 23 m in height, composed of ca. 20 internodes, casting off leaves at every node. Between the stem and leaf sheath develop the ears. These are female inflorescences, tightly covered over by several layers of ear leaves (husks). Elongated stigmas (silks) emerge from the whorl of husk leaves at the end of the ear. The apex of the stem ends in the tassel, an inflorescence of male flowers. An ear contains from 200 to 400 kernels, and is from 1025 centimetres in length (Figure 15). The 1000 kernel weight of corn is between 100 and 400 g, depending on the genotype and seed fraction (SF small flat, SR small round, LF large flat, LR large round). Figure 15 Maize \n",

St. Hil. Striped maize - Zea mays var. japonica According to the extended BBCH-scale, maize has the following principal phenological growth stages: 0: Germination 1: Leaf development 3: Stem elongation 5: Inflorescence emergence, heading 6: Flowering, anthesis 7: Development of fruit 8: Ripening 9: Senescence Maize is a protandric species, male flowers blooming prior to the female ones on the same plant to avoid self-fertilization. Its pollen is anemophilous (dispersed by wind). Maize is a facultative short-day plant and flowers in a certain number of growing degree days > 10 C in the environment to which it is adapted. The center of origin of maize is Mexico and Mesoamerica, the secondary center being South America. Maize belongs to the family Gramineae/Poaceae and it is diploid (2n=20). Today, hybrids based on various combinations of inbred lines are used in maize growing: Single cross (SC): A x B Modified SC (MSC): (A x A) x B (A is a sister-line of A) Three-way cross (TC): (A x B) x C Modified TC (MTC): (A x B) x (C x C) (C is a sister-line of C) Double cross (DC): (A x B) x (C x D) Highest level of hybrid vigor can be expected with SC hybrids. DC hybrids are theleast expensive and they are usually used as forage (silage). Genetically modified (GM) hybrids resistant to glyphosate or glufosinate herbicides as well as possessing insect resistance by Bt toxins are also cultivated in several countries. Environmental requirements Maize is a warm weather crop and is not grown in areas where the mean daily temperature is less than 19 C or where the mean of the summer months is less than 23 C. Although the minimum temperature for germination is 10 C, germination will be faster and less variable at soil temperatures of 16 to 18 C. Hardy varieties can grow already at a lower temperature of 6-8 C. Frost can damage maize at all growth stages and a frost-free period of 120 to 140 days is required to prevent damage.Its most sensible developmental period is between heading (tasseling) and the development of kernels with an optimum temperature of 24-26 C and the the maximum of water uptake (100-100 mm in July and in August). Its total water requirement is 450-550 mm (daily water consumption is is 4.5-5.5 mm/ha). \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 43Maize varieties are grouped several ways regarding the length of their growing period. One method uses the so-called FAO index/number (Table 17) but the grouping system can depend on company and country, too. Among cereals maize requires the best soil conditions. Because of its shallow roots, it is susceptible to droughts, intolerant of nutrient-deficient soils, and prone to be uprooted by severe winds. The most suitable soil for maize is one with a good effective depth, favourable morphological properties, good internal drainage, an optimal moisture regime, sufficient and balanced quantities of plant nutrients and chemical properties that are favourable specifically for maize production. Its pH optimum is between 6.6 (5.8) and 7.5 (8.0).

It can be grown even in monoculture for several years but rotation is an effective method of prevention against several pests such as western corn rootworm. Best forecrops are small grain cereals, pulses, legumes, rapes and other crops harvested early. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 18 and 19, respectively.

            " 44 Inter-row cultivation can be used to improve soil structure and as an alternative or supplement to chemical weed control by herbicides. Under continental climate, fodder maize is rarely irrigated due to economical reasons. If it is applied, irrigation must be performed prior to heading (50-60 mm), followed by 2-3 x 30-40 mm (12-14 days of rotation) and 50-60 mm at grain filling. Diseases Corn/common smut (Ustilago maydis), maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV), Fusarium graminearum, Fusarium verticilloides, common rust (Puccinia sorghi), Helminthosporium maydis Pests Cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), European corn borer, ECB (Ostrinia nubilalis), corn weevil (Tanymecus dilaticollis), fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda), western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte), aphid (Tetraneura ulmi) Harvesting Grain corn Grain corn is harvested by a combine at a moisture content below 20% if possible. In the case of varieties belonging to the half-late or later maturity group, this value is usually higher. Grain corn can be stored at 14-14.5% water content. Its average yield is 4-9 tons/ha. Forage maize Forage harvesters chop forage maize and also crack kernels. Harvesting forage maize between 28 and 32% dry matter content (grains: 35-38% moisture content, dough stage) promises the ideal combination of digestibility, starch content and dry matter yield factors. The best indicator of dry matter yield and silage quality is in the milk line score. At late grain fill stage, there is a visual line of separation between the starchy tip and the milky base of individual grains. The line moves down the grain towards the core of the cob over a six-week period (approximately). Optimal time for harvesting is when this milk line is half way down the length of individual grains. Corn-Cob Mix (CCM) The entire cob is harvested with a traditional forager using a picker header. The resulting product is slightly lower in energy density than crimped maize grain, but because it contains the spindle and husk, it provides a useful source of added fibre. CCM - which takes the cob and sheath - can be ready for harvesting 10-14 days after optimum timing for silage. Agronomically theres no difference in the management regime for CCM compared to maize silage. Preservative is added at harvest, producing a ready to ensile feed, without then need for a crimping machine. Another advantage is that it can be harvested 10-14 days earlier than crimping, but avoids clashing with the regular forage maize window. Ground Ear Maize (GEM) CCM differs from GEM in that a portion of the leaf around the cob is also present in the mix, adding to its scratch factor in the cattles diet. Ground ear maize is forage produced by ensiling the chopped maize ear and is harvested using a cob picker header mounted on a forage harvester. At harvesting the plant stems are pulled down through the header, chopped and spread over the soil. The cobs however are 'snapped' off the stem during this process and continue through the harvester where they are chopped. \n",

            " 452.1.7. Sorghums (Sorghum spp. ) Worldwide, sorghum is a food grain for humans. Paralel, in several countries sorghum is used primarily as a feed grain for livestock. Feed value of grain sorghum is similar to corn. The grain has more protein and fat than corn, but is lower in vitamin A. Grain sorghum feeding value ranges from 90% to nearly equal to corn. The grain is highly palatable to livestock, and intake seldom limits livestock productivity. However, some sorghum varieties and hybrids which were developed to deter birds are less palatable due to tannins and phenolic compounds in the seed. The grain should be cracked or rolled before feeding to cattle; this improves the portion digested. Its grain yield is 1.5-2.0 (9.0) t/ha. Forage sorghum silage is usually slightly lower in energy than corn silage and is similar in protein. Forage sorghum usually does not regrow following harvest, unlike sudangrass, so it is best adapted to a single-cut harvest for silage. Sudan grass hybrids fit best in summer feeding programs. They are thick stemmed and hard to dry for hay but they can supply ample yields of silage, green chop and pasture when perennial grasses are slowing down or going dormant. Its green mass is 30-50 (80) t/ha. Sudan grasses yield slightly lower than corn when harvested for silage, but they have the advantage that they can be cut 2-3 times during the season and can also be stored as either chopped silage or wrapped bale silage, green chopped or pastured. Corn silage produces more tons per hectare but it must be harvested in the fall with specialized forage harvesting equipment. Sudan grasses can also be harvested using a strip grazing system. They are thus more versatile to harvest than corn. Its potential green mass can reach 100 t/ha/year, dry yield is 18-25 t/ha. Figure 16 Grain sorghum (left), forage sorghum (centre), sudan grass (right) Botanical characteristics Sorghums are warm season grasses known for being drought resistant. They are more efficient in water absorption because they have twice as many secondary roots per unit of primary root as corn and have only half as much leaf area as corn for evaporation. Their water requirements are the same as corn but they have the ability to go dormant during extended drought periods. Growth will begin when the rains come.

            " 46 corn. Growth and development of sorghum is similar to corn, and other cereals. Sorghum seedlings are smaller than corn due to smaller seed size. The grain sorghum head is a panicle, with spikelets in pairs. Sorghums are normally self-fertilized, but can cross pollinate. Hybrid sorghum seed is produced utilizing cytoplasmic male sterility. Sorghum can branch from upper stalk nodes. If drought and heat damage the main panicle, branches can bear panicles and produce grain. The grain is free-threshing, as the lemma and palea are removed during combining. The seed color is variable with yellow, white, brown, and mixed classes in the grain standards. Brown-seeded types are high in tannins, which lower palatability (Figure 16). Forage sorghum (Sorghum dochna /F./ Snowden var. saccharatum) Forage sorghum hybrids have sweet juicy stems (juice: 70-80%, sugar: 18-22% of juice). They produce less than Sudan grass hybrids and have very slow regrowth. They have been selected for one-time harvesting. A sorghum hybrid should be harvested in the soft dough stage for maximum forage production (Figure 16). Sudan grass (Sorghum sudanense /P/ Stapf) This is a fine stemmed and leafy plant with very quick regrowth. It is best used for pasture or in multiple cut systems. If used in a one cut system, yields will be less than that of forage sorghum. Forage quality will be high due to low fiber content if cut frequently (Figure 16). The center of origin of sorghums is East and Central Africa. Sorghums belong to the family Gramineae/Poaceae and they are diploid (2n=20). Environmental requirements Low temperature, not length of growing season, is the limiting factor for production. For germination sorghum requires a soil temperature of 12-16 C. Average temperatures of at least 21 C during July are needed for maximum yields. Sorghum is more tolerant of wet soils and flooding than most of the grain crops. It is drought tolerant. Most of the poorly drained, wet soils are too cold for grain sorghum. Optimal pH is between 5.5 and 8.5.

The use of a cultipacker or corrugated roller after seeding often gives better stands. In warmer regions, reduced- and no-tillage systems can be used. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 20 and 21, respectively. A popular and effective mode of cultivation is sowing forage maize and forage sorghum in a combination of 2 + 2 rows (Table 22). It has a beneficial effect especially under arid conditions because maize keeps green longer, otherwise the juicier green mass of sorghum compensates that of maize drying earlier. \n",

August-15. September Green mass: 30-40 t/ha Harvesting Grain sorghum is harvested as a standing crop with a combine. Combining time will depend on the fall weather. Sorghum grain can be threshed free of the head when the seed moisture is 20-25%. Frost will generally kill the top of the plant and help to lower the moisture content. Sorghum seed is easily damaged in the threshing operation, especially when the grain is dry. The grain sorghum crop can be harvested for high-moisture grain silage. When fed to livestock, its digestibility will be increased by grinding or rolling. High moisture grain sorghum can be combined and ensiled when the grain is about 25-30% moisture. The first Sudan grass cut is ready for harvest about 60 days from planting. The plants should be ca. 90-120 cm in height, and just before head emergence when cut. For a faster recovery of aftermath growth, leave at least 10 to 18 cm of stubble when harvesting. Optimum growth of these plants occurs under hot, moist conditions. A second cut should be ready 30-35 days later. At cutting, the crop is about 70-75% moisture and requires wilting before ensiling. To promote fermentation, additives of high dry matter content (e.g. alfalfa, corn) can be added. Sudan grass may be pastured but livestock should not enter before the plants are 45 cm high. Trampling damage will be very high unless a strip or rotational grazing system is used. As the plants will reach this height by mid summer and are drought resistant, this can provide a source of feed during the summer slump of pastures. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 48 Feed quality and animal health hazards. Once Sudan grass begins to head out, the quality and feeding value drop drastically. As the crop matures, protein content drops rapidly (from 17 to 8%), while fibre levels increase. This decreases the feed energy value and rumen digestibility. Sudangrass can contain as much protein as mature alfalfa, but only if harvested at the vegetative stage. Energy levels in vegetative material are similar to corn and higher than alfalfa. Prussic acid poisoning. Sorghum species contain various amounts of cyanogenic glucosides. In the rumen, these compounds are converted into prussic acid, which is readily absorbed into the blood. High blood levels of prussic acid interfere with respiration and cattle can soon die from respiratory paralysis. Horses should not be allowed to graze these plants as they may develop cystitis syndrome. There is no treatment for this poisoning and poor prognosis of recovery. Management practices that can reduce risk of prussic acid poisoning: Graze or green chop only when forage is greater than 45 cm tall for sudangrass or greater than 55 to 65 cm for forage sorghum hybrids. Do not graze plants during or immediately after a drought, or where growth has been reduced; on nights when a frost is likely. High levels of the toxic compounds are produced within hours after a frost occurs; after a killing frost until the plant is dry and brown ascyanogenic glucosides usually dissipate within 7 days and after a non-killing frost until regrowth is at least 45 cm tall. Do not green chop or ensile the forage for 3 to 5 days after a killing frost. Allow forage to ensile for at least 3 weeks before feeding. Nitrate poisoning and formation of toxic silo gas. High nitrate levels are only a problem under abnormal growing conditions. High nitrate levels will persist in forages cut for hay, but will be reduced by 50% when ensiled for 30 to 60 days. When high nitrate forage is ensiled, deadly nitrogen dioxide gas (silo gas) can be produced within hours, and be a concern for at least 3 weeks. In spite of these potential problems with Sorghum-Sudan grass, it is a good emergency forage during summer conditions. Its quality is variable, making its feeding value more suited to low producers, dry cows and heifer replacements. It provides an alternative feed source during the summer months when existing pastures may be producing less, or may be a valuable feed supplement until other forages are ready. 2.1.8. Proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) The term millet is applied to various grass crops whose seeds are harvested for food or feed. The five millet species of commercial importance are proso, foxtail, barnyard (Echinochloa frumentaceae L.), browntop (Panicum ramosum) and pearl (Pennisetum glaucum). Millets are some of the oldest of cultivated crops. In China, records of culture for foxtail and proso millet extend back to 2000 to 1000 BC. The major uses of proso millet are as a component of grain mixes for parakeets, canaries, finches, lovebirds, cockatiels and wild birds and as feed for cattle, sheep, hogs and poultry. Large bright or red seed is preferred. Proso millet as livestock feed is similar to oats and barley in feeding value. It is commonly fed in ground form to cattle, sheep, and hogs. Whole seed can be fed to poultry. The protein values compare favorably with sorghum and wheat and are higher than corn. Proso also has considerably higher fiber levels, due to attached hulls. Proso performs best in livestock rations when fed in mixtures with other grains. If the amino acid levels are balanced, the feeding value to hogs is nearly equal to corn. Proso can be cut for hay, but it is not as suitable as foxtail for this purpose. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 49Foxtail millet is usually grown for hay or silage often as a short-season emergency hay crop. Some seed is used for finch and wild bird feeds. It does not necessarily yield more forage than proso but is free of foliage hairs and is finer stemmed. For forage, foxtail millet is harvested at the late boot to late bloom stage. Foxtail millet should not be fed to horses as the only source of roughage since it acts as a laxative. If foxtail millet has been severely stressed it may accumulate nitrate at levels toxic for livestock. Botanical characteristics Millets are annual grasses. Proso millet grows to a height of approximately 1 m and has a hollow stem. Both stems and leaves are curved with short hairs. Proso millet has a large, open panicle inflorescence. When the grain is threshed, most of the seed remains enclosed in the inner hull. Hulls are extremely variable in color and, depending on the variety, may be white, red, yellow, brown or striped (Figure 17 left). Foxtail millet has slender, erect leafy stems and may grow up to 1.25 m tall. The inflorescence is a dense, bristly panicle resembling the panicles of weedy foxtails. As in proso millet, the seeds are enclosed in the hull and also range in color from creamy white, red, yellow or dark purple (Figure 17 right). Both proso and foxtail millet are highly self-pollinated but have been known to occasionally outcross. Proso and foxtail millet are short season crops. Figure 17 Proso millet (left) and foxtail millet (right) The center of origin of proso millet is central and eastern Asia, the secondary centre of origin being India, Russia, the Middle East and Europe. Proso millet belongs to the family Gramineae/Poaceae and it is diploid (2n=36), largely self-pollinated plant. The center of origin of foxtail millet is China. Foxtail millet belongs to the family Gramineae/Poaceae and it is diploid (2n=18), largely self-pollinated plant. Environmental requirements Millets require warm temperatures for germination and development and are sensitive to frost. Optimum soil temperatures for seed germination are between 20 and 30 C. Proso and foxtail millet are efficient users of water and grow well in areas of low moisture, partly because they are early and thereby avoid periods of drought. Millets are often grown as \n",

They will not tolerate water-logged soils or extreme drought. Proso millet does not perform well on coarse, sandy soils. A pH of 5.6 or higher is recommended for millet.

Weeds should be controlled prior to planting and the seedbed should be firm and well-worked. Since millets are planted late in the season, spring plowing and cultivation for weed control are practical. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 23 and 24-25, respectively.

Seeds in the lower half of the panicle may still be in the dough stage but should have lost their green color. At this point, the leaves and stems may still be green. Millet is usually harvested by swathing to allow drying of straw before combining. Swathing too early reduces yield, test weight and color quality. Harvesting too late increases loss as a result of shattering and lodging. Rodents and birds can cause damage to proso during ripening. Control programs are often needed. Millet seed should be stored at 13% moisture or less. Foxtail millet should be harvested for hay or silage from the late boot to bloom stage. At this stage, hay quality is at its peak, and protein levels of 12 to 14% may be common. As the plant matures, protein declines. Also mature bristles from delayed harvest may cause lump jaw and sore eyes in cattle feeding from bunks. When harvesting foxtail millet for seed production, it should not be cut until completely ripe, then swathed and threshed. Sometimes it is direct combined after a killing frost, but some seed loss will occur. 2.1.9. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Rice is the third most important cereal in the world based on the sowing area (until the end of the 2000s it was the second one). It is primarily used as food: brown (whole grain, hulled) or white (hulled and polished) rice, rice debris (for spirit and starch production), rice flour/powder (in cannned and baby food, food for people suffering celiac disease, etc.), etc. Bran and other by-products of hulling are used for both food and animal feeding. Husks removed at hulling can be utilized for feeding, for soil improvement, as litter, as filter material, etc. Straw gives raw material for cellulose processing, rope production, etc. Protein content of rice (7.5%) is lower than that of wheat, however its essential amino acid composition is better, similar to that of animal proteins. Rice contains high levels of dietary fibres (14%), vitamins B1, B3, B6, as well as iron, magnesium, manganese, selenium and zinc. The beneficiary nutritional value of rice is mainly lost via the removel of bran layer (polishing) from brown rice. Its starch is easily digestable. Botanical characteristics Rice has four major categories worldwide (with overlaps between the different types): indica (non-sticky, long-grained; grown mainly submerged in tropical areas), japonica (sticky, short-grained; grown in sub-tropical and temperate areas), aromatic (medium to long-grained of nut-like taste and aroma: e.g. basmati, jasmine rice), glutinous (sticky/sweet/waxy rice of low amylose content mainly grown in Southeast and East Asia). Rice is an annual grass. Its general morphological characteristics and growth stages resemble those of other small grain cereals. It can be 0.8-1.8 m tall. Its inflorescence is a panicle (Figure 18). Caryopses are covered by husk which cannot be removed via threshing. Removal of husks (husking) results brown rice. Polishing removes the outer bran layer of kernel resulting white rice. 1000 kernel weight of rice is 25-35 g. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 52 The centres of origin of rice are supposed to be South-eastern Asia (India, Myanmar and Thailand) and West Africa. Rice is a diploid (2n=12), primarily self-pollinating plant. Figure 18 Rice Environmental requirements Rice is a warm demanding crop. It can be safely grown to 40 latitude. Under temperate climate its growing period is 130-150 days and the cumulative seasonal heat unit is 2600-3000 C although e.g. in Hungary it reaches only 1400-1500 C. C. Regarding temperature, the critical growth stages are germination (12-14 C), tillering (16-18 C), flower development and flowering (20-22 C). Large fluctuations in temperature cause stress resulting in increased panicle sterility. Insolation has less effect on yield elements during the vegetative development but its effect increases during the reproductive stage, it has poisitve correlation with yield. Precipitation has indirect effect on rice development. Rice has unique requirements regarding soil quality. It needs soils of poor water permeability with aquitard close to soil surface. Total salt content must not exceed 0.4-0.6%, soda content 0.1%. The pH optimum is 5-6. Meadow, meadow solonetz and solonetz meadow soils work well. Rice is hygrophyte that does not require much water but water must be available in sufficient amount in the course of the whole growing period. Besides providing water continuously, the traditional method of flooding the fields act as temperature buffer under temperate climate, furthermore it reduces the growth of weed plants and deters several other pests. Cultivation Traditionally, rice is cultivated in monoculture. Under temperate climate (e.g. in Hungary), however crop rotation is preferred. Thus rice is cultivated in monoculture for 3-5 years, followed by fallow and occasionally manuring. It can be followed by (perennial) legumes, then small grain cereals or rape. In Hungary the paddy fields of 30-50 ha are traditionally divided into parcels of 4-6 ha. Tillage in the dry period serves the drying of the tilth of soil and the control of weeds. Care must be taken not to mix subsoil of high salt concentration into the upper layer. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 26 and 27, respectively. In general, the effective ingredient doses are 70-120 kg/ha N, 50-80 kg/ha P and 40-50 kg/ha \n",

Sowing into soil is preferred due to the rapid growth of plants and the ease of weed and pest control. It requires a soil temperature of 12 C. The field is flooded at the growth stage of 2-3 leaves. Sowing on the soil surface can be applied in the case of late sowing. It requires a temperature of 14-15 C, pressing seeds to soil by rolling and immediate flooding with 3-5 cm water right after sowing is needed. Sowing into water is usually done by broadcasting from airplane. Seeds should be soaked for 24 hours then drained for 24-36 hours before aerial seeding. Fields must be drained immediately after seeding. Flooding up is performed slowly until tillering. The traditional way of cultivating rice from seedlings is not wide-spread in temperate zones. Rice does not require deep water cover: wet soil at germinating, 3-5 cm increased up to 20 cm (upper third of the plant) for the second half of development. Final drainage can be started at the start of full ripening. Upland rice technology (dry rice) was adapted to temperate conditions. Upland rice is grown in rainfed fields (rainfall 1,000-4,500 mm/year) at altitudes up to 2,000 metres. Upland rice varieties are adapted to poor soils, show improved blast resistance and drought tolerance. These can outyield traditional rices by more than 100%. Under temperate climate, upland rice is cultivated similarily to other small grain cereals with regular irrigation applied with a maximum rotation of one week.

Pea is one of the oldest cultivated plants in the world, it was domesticated the same time as cereals. The growing area is 6,593,926.47 ha for dry and 2,266,368.61 ha for green pea. The global production is 9,830,015.66 tons for dry and 18,490,919.89 tons for green pea (FAO, 2012). For human consumption, the immature (green) peas (or the tender pod in snow peas) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned, while varieties of field peas are grown to produce dry peas (green or yellow split pea shelled from the matured pod). Fodder pea (mostly varieties of Pisum sativum L. ssp. arvense /L./ POIR.) has a multipurpose use in livestock nutrition (green fodder, grain, silage etc.). However, compared to non-legumes, its yields are very variable and advancement in this field is very slow. Being high N-fixers, field peas produce abundant vining forage and contribute to short-term soil conditioning. Succulent stems break down easily and are a quick source of available N. Field peas grow rapidly in the cool, moist weather as winter annuals and as early-sown summer annuals. Further benefits of field pea growing: Bountiful biomass. Under a long, cool, moist season during their vegetative stages, winter peas produce more than 5.8 t/ha dry matter, even when planted in spring in colder climates. Nitrogen source. As Rhizobium bacteria living in symbiosis with pulses are able to 'fix' nitrogen, field peas are top N producers, yielding from 100 to 170 kg N/ha, and at times up to 350 kg N/ha. Rotational effects. Pulse crops (grain legumes such as field peas, faba beans and lentils) improve sustainability of dryland crop rotations by providing disease suppression, better tilth and other enhancements to soil quality. Quick growing. Rapid spring growth helps peas out compete weeds and make an N contribution in time for summer cash crops in some areas. Forage booster. Field peas grown with barley, oat, triticale or wheat provide excellent livestock forage. Peas slightly improve forage yield, but significantly boost protein and relative feed value of small grain hay. Long-term bloomer. The purple and white blossoms of field peas are an early and extended source of nectar for honeybees. Botanical characteristics Field pea is an annual, cool-season, pulse crop. It has a taproot system of mediocre strength. There are two main types of field pea regarding growth habit. One type is an aggressive climbing variety and the other is a bush or dwarf type. Field pea stems grow from 60 to 100 cm (in the case of forage peas up to 150-200 cm) in length. Each leaf has a branched tendril at its tip and one to three pairs of leaflets. Most varieties of field pea produce white (P.s. ssp. hortense) (Figure 19) or reddish-purple (P.s. ssp. arvense) (Figure 20) flowers. Field pea stems (or vines) are prostrate at maturity. The pods contain from four to nine seeds and may be up to 8-10 cm in length. Fodder pea grown for grain has high protein content (20-25%). The seed color is often green or yellow like at those produced for human consumption (P.s. ssp. hortense) but it can be dark brownish or mottled (P.s. ssp. arvense), too. The 1000 seed weight is 100-300 g. \n",

Figure 19 Field pea Figure 20 Fodder pea Pea has several convarieties, the most importants being: - Round peas (P. sativum L. convar. sativum) The surface of the ripe seeds is smooth (Figure 21 left). Seed coat can be easily removed (dehulling) thus split peas are produced. Round peas lose tenderness quickly. They are usually utilized after cooking. For other purposes harvesting at early stages of ripening is necessary. - Wrinkled peas (P. sativum L. convar. medullare Alef.) The surface of the ripe seeds is wrinkled (Figure 21 right). Wrinkled peas convert a low proportion of their sugar content into starch. The sugar level builds up inside the pea (6-9%, almost 100% sucrose), so they taste sweeter than the round ones. They cannot be dehulled. Wrinkled peas are utilized fresh, canned or deep-frozen. \n",

            " 58 - Snow peas (P. sativum L. convar. axiphium Alef.) Their pods are free from parchment (hard endoderm), they feature flat pods that are sweet and edible (a.k.a. sugar peas). The seeds are very tiny, can be eaten fresh or cooked, traditional in stir-fry. They are called snap peas when they have plump and rounded edible pods instead of flat ones. It tends to be very sweet, and can be eaten raw or cooked. Figure 21 Round (left) and wrinkled (right) peas According to the extended BBCH-scale, pea has the following principal phenological growth stages: 0: Germination 1: Leaf development 3: Stem elongation (main shoot) 5: Inflorescence emergence 6: Flowering 7: Development of fruit 8: Ripening of fruit and seed 9: Senescence The germination of pea is hypogeal (cotyledons remain below ground). Pea is a self-pollinating, long-day plant. Pods mature from the lowest flowering node upwards. At (over)ripening pea is prone to pod shattering and seed drop. Its center of origin is Central Asia, the Near East, Abyssinia and the Mediterranean. Pea belongs to the family Fabaceae/Leguminosae and it is a diploid species (2n=14). Pea is rich in protein (22-24%) and minerals. Carbohydrate content is 50-55%, fat content is 1.3-1.6%. It is rich in vitamins B1, B2 and C. Environmental requirements Peas are not heat-demanding crops. They germinate at 4.4 C and at 2-3 leaves stage they tolerate some grades of frost. Overwintering forage peas are winter-hardy (-15-20 C). The maximum temperature at vegetative growing is 12-14 C, at flowering- ripening 18-20 C. Pea has a moderate water requirement (200-250 mm), its transpiration coefficient being 300-500. It utilizes water relatively well but it is sensitive for drought at early stages of development and in the reproductive stage from flowering to pod set. Peas are crops of the better wheat soils rich in lime (pH 6.5-8). \n",

            " 59Cultivation Its best and most common fore- and aftercrops are cereals. Other suitable forecrops are crucifers, flax and row crops fertilized with manure (e.g. potato, sugar beet). Rotation is 3-4 yars. Pulses and legumes as well as other crops harvested late and leaving root and stem residues must be avoided as forecrops. Pea itself is an excellent forecrop for most non-relative crops. Tillage resembles those described for spring crops. Seedbed levelling is essential in order to reduce losses at harvesting. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 29 and 30, respectively. Among pulses peas have the highest demand for calcium. Irrigation is needed especially for green pea: 30-40 mm in rotation of 14 days.

Green pea is harvested by a pea harvester (pod stripper/combine). Its yield is 5-8 t/ha. Dry and fodder peas For grain food or feed, peas must be harvested by a specifically modified cereal combine at full ripening (16-18% moisture content) when leaves are dry, pods are yellow, seeds are hard. Combine must be equipped with a floating flexible cutter platform. If harvested by the inderect way (e.g. in the case of weedy fields or heterogenous ripening) cut plants are left on the field for post-ripening followed by threshing by a combine. Its grain yield is 3-5 t/ha. For green forage or haylage, it can be mown at flowering according to the livestocks demand. Its green mass is 20-35 t/ha. Field peas for hay should be harvested when most of the pods are well formed. Harvesting can be performed by using a mower with lifting guards and a windrow attachment to handle the sprawling vines. 2.2.2. Soybean (Glycine max /L./ Merr.) Soybean is the fifth largest arable crop in the world regarding its growing area (104,997,252.85 ha). Its global production is 241,841,416.45 tons (FAO, 2012). Soybean provides vegetable protein for millions of people and ingredients for hundreds of chemical products, including paints, adhesives, fertilizers, insect sprays, and fire-extinguisher fluids. Because soybeans contain no starch, they are a good source of protein for diabetics. Processed for food, soybean oil is made into margarine, shortening, and vegetarian cheeses and meats. Soybean is considered to be a source of complete protein that contains significant amounts of all the essential amino acids (e.g. tryptophane, lysine, valine, leucin, tyrosine) that must be provided to the human body. It has a nutritional value similar to that of animal protein. Soybean meal serves as a high-protein meat substitute in many food products, including baby foods. Other food products include soybean milk, tofu, salad sprouts, and soy sauce. Soy is extremely important as a relatively inexpensive source of protein and oil. Soy meal is the single most important animal feed in the EU, accounting for 55% of protein-rich animal feed. Soybean can be utilized in several ways as fodder (e.g. soybean meal, seed), green forage, hay as well as silage. On ca. 75% of the total cultivation area GM soybean is produced. Most of the GM cultivars are herbicide tolerant and/or insect resistant but genotypes of modified oil composition are also commercially available. Botanical characteristics Soybean is a heat-demanding annual pulse crop. It has a deep root system. Soy varies in growth and habit. The height of the plant can be from below 20 up to 200 cm. The stems, leaves and pods are covered with fine brown or gray hairs. The leaves are trifoliolate, having 3 to 4 leaflets per leaf, and the leaflets are 615 cm long. The leaves fall before the seeds are mature. The inconspicuous, self-fertile flowers are borne in the axil of the leaf and are white, pink or purple. The fruit is a hairy pod that grows in clusters of 35, each pod is 38 cm long and usually contains 24 seeds 511 mm in diameter. Soybeans occur in various sizes, and \n",

Soybean is a self-pollinating, short-day plant. Soybean is less prone to pod shattering and seed drop compared to pea. The center of origin of soybean is Northeast China and Manchuria. It belongs to the family Fabaceae/Leguminosae and it is a diploid species (2n=40). Soybean has a high crude protein content of 40% (31.7-43.2%) and a high oil content of 20% (18.3-24.9%) which are in a strong negative correlation with each other (r=-0.7). Soybean oil is a major source of lecithin (2% of oil). Soybean is high in carotene, vitamin B, D and E. Soybean contains proteinase inhibitors such as the Kunitz- and BowmanBirk-type trypsin and chymotrypsin inhibitors. These can be neutralized via extraction, as well as through hydrothermic, acidic, heat or microwave treatment. Environmental requirements Soybean is relatively resistant to low and very high temperatures but growth rates decrease above 35 C and below 18 C. Minimum temperatures for growth are about 10 C and for crop production about 15 C. Only 25 to 30% of the flowers set pods, the final number depending on the plant vigour during the flowering period. Year to year temperature variations can lead to differences in flowering. Soybean is basically a short-day plant, but response to daylength varies with variety and temperature and developed varieties are \n",

            " 62 adapted only to rather narrow latitude differences. The length of the total growing period is 100 to 130 days or more. Soybean is a water-demanding crop, distribution of precipitation has determining role. Its transpiration coefficient is 750-800. Maximum of water requirement lasts from the beginning of flowering to the end of pod setting. Low water supply combined with high temperature can lead to the drop of flowers or fruits. From germination to budding and in the ripening stage soybean plants are relatively drought resistant. Soybean can be grown on a wide range of soils except for those which are very sandy. Optimum soil pH is 6 to 6.5. A shallow water table, particularly during the early growth period can adversely affect yields. The plant is sensitive to waterlogging, but moderately tolerant to soil salinity. Table 31 Nutrient requirement of soybean Nutrient uptake to 1 ton of grain N: 62 kg/t P2O5: 37 kg/t K2O: 51 kg/t CaO: 42 kg/t MgO: 9 kg/t Cultivation Best forecrops are small-grain cereals and maize. Besides pulses and leguminous crops, rapeseed, sunflower and other crops susceptible for Septoria infection should be avoided as forecrop. Rotation is 4 years. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 31 and 32, respectively. Table 32 Sowing data of soybean Sowing date: 15-30. April Row distance: 45-50 (70) cm Sowing depth: 3-5 cm Seed rate: - very early (MG 00), early (MG 0) - middle late (MG I) - late (MG II) 650,000 seeds/ha 600,000 seeds/ha 550,000 seeds/ha 30-35 seeds/m of row (45-50 cm) 38-40 seeds/m of row (70 cm) 70-150 kg/ha 1000 seed weight: 130-220 g Seeds or soil must be treated with a Bradirhizobium japonicum concentrate right prior to sowing to improve N-fixation. An efficient weed control has a decisive role in soybean yield. Soybean is usually not grown under full irrigation. In certain climatic conditions, however, one or more supplemental irrigations during critical growth periods will increase yields. If one application is given, the best timing is in the late flowering period, when small pods are beginning to appear. If two applications are given, the first application is usually given at pre-emergence to assure a rapid establishment of the plant. A third application, where possible, will give the best results if given at the beginning of pod filling. Under dry continental climate, 2-3 x 40-50 mm doses between early June to mid-August (or even 2-4 x 50-60 mm, 160-180mm) can be given. \n",

Soybeans can be harvested at moisture levels below 20%, but they must be stored at 14% moisture or lower. Harvest losses and mechanical damage may be high when soybeans are harvested below 12% moisture. A floating cutterbar can be used to cut the soybean plants off, closer to ground level. Header maintenance is important. The majority of soybean losses occur at the header. Yield can vary widely with water availability, fertilization and row spacing. Under rainfed conditions, good soybean yields vary between 1.5 and 2.5 t/ha seed. High yields of improved varieties are between 2.5 and 3.5 ton/ha seed under irrigation. Rough soybean seeds contain antinutritive compounds such as trypsin and lipase inhibitors. Both chemicals can be neutralized by various heat or chemical treatments in the course of seed processing. 2.2.3. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) Common bean (a.k.a. string bean, field bean, French bean, garden bean, etc.) is a food crop cultivated worldwide. Its dry or fresh seeds (shell beans) as well as the unripe fruits (snap beans utilized fresh, canned or deep-frozen) are used for human consumption. The leaves are occasionally used as vegetable, while the straw and other by-products of harvesting and processing (defected seeds, pod rests, etc.) can be used for fodder. Further benefits of common bean growing resemble those detailed for field pea regarding biomass, nitrogen source and rotational effects with the possibility for growing as second crop added. Besides common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), among others runner bean (Ph. coccineus L.), butter/lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.), mung bean (Vigna radiata Wilczek/Ph. aureus Roxb.) are also grown under temperate climate. Botanical characteristics The common bean is a highly variable species. According to the growth habit there are two basic types: bush varieties form erect, selfsupporting bushes of 2060 cm (Ph. vulgaris L. convar. nanus), while pole/running varieties form vines of 23 m (Phaseolus vulgaris L. convar. vulgaris/communis). Beans have a relatively weak taproot system of 1-1.4 m depth. They have alternate leaves divided into three oval, smooth-edged leaflets, each being 615 cm long and 311 cm wide. The inflorescence is raceme of racemes. The papilionaceous flowers are white, pink, or purple. The pods are 525 cm long and 11.5(3) cm wide. These can be green or yellow (occasionally black or purple) in color, and contain 46(50) seeds (beans). The beans are smooth, plump, kidney-shaped, up to 1.5(3) cm long. They vary extremely widely in color (white, red, cream, black, brown, etc.), and are often mottled in two or more colors (Figure 23). \n",

Common bean and lima bean are self-pollinated, while runner bean is cross-polinated. Flowering happens from the lowest flower upwards (acropetal). The center of origin of common bean is Central and South America (Soth Mexico, Bolivia, Peru). Common bean belongs to the family Fabaceae/Leguminosae and it is a diploid species (2n=22). Bean is rich in protein (20-25%) with high lysine, cistine, tryptophan and histidine content. Carbohydrate content is 50-57%, oil content is 0.7-1.5%. It is rich in vitamins A, B1, B2, B 6 and E, as well as in iron, potassium, selenium and molybdenum. Environmental requirements Beans belong to the arable crops requiring the warmest conditions throughout their life cycle. It can be damaged already below 2 C. Germination starts at 10-12 C the optimum being 22-26 C. For vegetative development 15-18 C is preferred. In generative stage 20-24 C is sufficient, the optimum being 24-28 C. The bean species show high variability regarding the length of the growing period: Ph. vulgaris 80-140 days, Ph. lunatus 120-150 days, Ph. coccineus >140 days. Growing period of green beans can be extremely short: 50-80 days. Beans are daylength tolerant or short-day plants. They require a continuous water supply of appropriate level. The highest water requirement can be detected between budding/flowering and pod set. In the case of water scarcity accompanied with temperature above 26 C, the abscission of flowers or developing pods can happen. \n",

            " 65Beans prefer well-drained soils of loose structure which warm up quickly, are rich in lime (pH 6.5-8) and are in good general condition. Brown forest soils, cernozems, humic sand and alluvial soil are among the best, while compact meadow and loose sandy soils are of less importance. Cold, deep located soils, alkaline soils, eroded soils of shallow tilth should be avoided. Beans do not tolerate slack water and high salinity. Cultivation Its best forecrops are small grain cereals, potato, flax, hemp and sweet corn but maize, poppy and root vegetables are also accepted. If sown as second crop, early-harvested forage mixes, crimson clover, rapeseed, winter barley or green pea are preferred. Sunflower, tomato, bulb crops, weedy areas and areas with pesticide residues should be avoided. Rotation is 4-5 years. Tillage resembles those described for spring crops. If sown as second crop, shallow tillage (e.g. disc harrow or rotary tiller) and compacting (rollers) is necessary. Seedbed levelling is essential in order to reduce losses at harvesting. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 33 and 34, respectively. If cultivated by hand (e.g. pole beans), other planting systems such as twin-row or strip-sowing, planting in hills are also applied. In general, the effective ingredient doses are 40-70 kg/ha N, 45-75 kg/ha P and 60-100 kg/ha K. Bean is sensitive for scarcities in boron, molybdenum, zinc and copper. Inter-row cultivation is used to improve soil structure and as an alternative or supplement to chemical weed control by herbicides.

Beans are generally ready for harvest ca. 10-14 days after pod set. Green beans can be harvested by hand (in gardens, small area, pole beans) or by a green bean harvester. Its yield is 7-9 t/ha. Dry beans Dry beans are ready for harvest when leaves are yellow and majority of them has fallen, some of the pods are yellow, dry and wizened, beans are hard, they reached the size, shape and color typical for the genotype. Seed moisture content is 16-18(20)%. It is advised not to wait until all pods are fully ripened because too many dry pods at harvest can result in heavy shattering. Nearly mature dry beans in the yellow pods will continue to ripen after they are cut. Straight combining is recommended only if the field is free of weeds and the crop ripens uniformly. In the case of weediness and heterogeneous ripening, desiccation can be applied. Other method for harvesting is undercutting and windrowing followed by combining from the windrow in ca. 1-2 days. Shattering can be reduced if undercutting and windrowing are performed at night or early in the morning when the plants are damp with dew. To avoid seed discoloration, a harvest period relatively free from rain is required. Dry bean yield is 1.2-2.5 t/ha. Storage is allowed at seed moisture of maximum 14%, following weevil control. 2.2.4.

The growing area is 19,202,081.65 ha, the global production is 364,808,768.31 tons (FAO, 2012). Potato is staple food in various forms such as pommes frites, chips, puree, flour, salad, etc. In industry potato is used as the source of starch, spirit, sugar. It has importance as forage, too. Potato is rich in starch (12-14%, up to 23%), vitamin C (20-25 mg/100 g) and potassium (1700-2000 mg% in d.m.). It has low protein content (1-2%). The toxic solanine is usually produced in tuber exposed to sunshine. Table 37 The EAPR (European Association for Potato Research) classification of potato varieties according to their cooking behavior Cooking type Description A particularly firm, non-mealy potato with a fine structure; for salads B firm, slightly mealy potato with a fine or rather fine structure; for mixed utilization, pommes frites C rather loose, mealy potato; for puree flakes, pasta raw material, chips D loose, very mealy potato; for puree flakes Botanical characteristics Potato has an adventitious root system arising from the base of a sprout. Root growth is usually restricted to the top soil layer of 20-30 cm depth. Potato stem is stout, erect, flexuous, much branched, slightly hairy, 30-60 cm long. The main stem arises from the first and high order buds. Branches arise from below ground nodes on the main stem. Underground stems are called stolon the end of which may form a tuber. Potato leaf is composed of two to four pairs of primary leaflets arranged on the mid-rib with a terminal leaflet on the end. Between the primary leaflets secondary and tertiary leaflets can be present. The leaf is attached to the plant by a petiole. The inflorescence is a scorpioid cyme born on the apex. The color of flowers is from white to dark lilac depending on genotype (Figure 24). Potato fruit is a berry. Figure 24 Potato \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 71The vegetative propagating organ of potato, the tuber is a thickened modified stem having cells filled with starch. The end of the tuber which joins the stolon is called the stem end, the other end where the eyes are clustered is known as the bud or apical end. Tuber skin colour may be red, pink or blue, purple or white or yellow. Flesh colours may be white, creamy white, creamy yellow or yellow. Skin and flesh color does not have any relation with potato quality (Table 37). According to the extended BBCH-scale, potato has the following principal phenological growth stages: 0: Sprouting/Germination 1: Leaf development 2: Formation of basal side shoots below and above soil surface (main stem) 3: Main stem elongation (crop cover) 4: Tuber formation 5: Inflorescence (cyme) emergence 6: Flowering 7: Development of fruit 8: Ripening of fruit and seed 9: Senescence Tuber initiation (40) is approximately parallel with the inflorescence emergence (51). The centers of origin of potato are upland areas of Chile, southern Peru, northwestern Bolivia and Equador. Potato belongs to the family Solanaceae. It is a tetraploid species (2n=48). Environmental requirements Potato is a temperate climate crop, however it grows under a diverse range of climatic conditions. Depending on genotype, its growing period is 85-125 days long. It prefers moderately cool temperature during the growing season (effective heat unit: 1300-1500 C). Sprouting starts at 6-8 C. It withstands frost to -1.5 C. Potatoes are sensitive to heavy frosts, which damage them in the ground. Even cold weather makes potatoes more susceptible to bruising and possibly later rotting, which can quickly ruin a large stored crop. The vegetative growth of the plant is best at a temperature of 21-24 C, while tuber development is favoured at 17-20 C. For the optimal development of tubers a significant difference between day and night temperatures is essential. Potato has a moderate (500-600 m) but continuous water requirement. The maximum need is during flowering parallel with tuber development (300-350 mm). During ripening and harvesting dry and warm weather is preferred. While flowering requires long days, tuberization of potato is induced by short days and prevented by long days. Different genotypes, however, probably have different requirements and temperature can also influence the effect of daylength. Potato can be grown on a wide range of soils. Naturally loose soils offering least resistance to the enlargement of the tubers are preferred. Loamy and sandy loam soils, rich in organic matter with good drainage and aeration, free of chemical residues and rhizomatous perenjnial weeds are most suitable for cultivation of potato crop. The soil with pH range of (4.5)5.2-6.4(7.5) is considered to be ideal. Compact, cold, eroded, saline and alkaline soils must be avoided. Cultivation Potato has special raquirements for forecrops. The best are small-grain cereals, rapeseed, pulses, white mustard and oilseed raddish. Green manure plants such as oilseed raddish, yellow lupin (on acidic sand), sweet clover (on alkaline sand). Following forecrops must \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 72 be avoided: late harvested crops of high water consumption (maize, sorghum, foxtail millet); crops leaving much stem residues (sunflower); weediness (alfalfa); Solanaceae species (tomato, pepper, tobacco, eggplant); lupins grown for seed, vegetables, herbs and spices leaving much root residues. Rotation must be 3 years on loose and 4 years on medium-compact soils. Potato can be followed rye, winter barley, wheat and spring crops, while sugar beet, sunflower, tomato andlupins must be avoided. Potato requires an appropriately prepared soil and seed bed. Following stubble cleaning, primary tillage can be performed by autumn or spring (on extreme loose sand) mouldboard or chisel plowing at 20-25 cm followed by spring secondary tillage at 15-18 cm (12-15 cm for early potato). Potato can be planted also into pre-formed beds which are established by using either a mulching machine or a lister and bed shaper. After establishing the beds, a chisel is run into the center of the bed to ca. 45 cm. An advantage of this practice is breaking up plow soles, which results in better water drainage and soil aeration. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 38 and 39, respectively. In general, the effective ingredient doses are 150-200 kg/ha N, 60-80 kg/ha P and 180-240 kg/ha K. Potato is a chloride-sensitive crop thus the widely used potassium-chloride should be avoided. Potassium-sulphate can be applied as basic fertilizer while potassium-nitrate for topdressing. Farmyard and green manures have beneficial effect on growing and quality. Seed potato can be round-oval (cross-diameter: 28-45/45-60 mm) or long (25-35/35-45 mm) and 45-150 g. Sedd potato of smaller size result in tubers of bigger size. Higher number of primary shoots per m2 results in tubers of smaller size. Tubers cut into small pieces containing minimum 2 eyes can also be used for planting after suberization. Figure 25 Chitted potato seed Potato seeds need to be chitted (sprouting the tubers) prior to planting early potato. It is performed by putting tubers, most eyes upright, in a light (60-100 lux), cool but frost-free place at about 12-18 C. Strong, short green shoots of 1.5-2 cm develop in 2-4 weeks (Figure 25).

            " 73Hilling (earthing up, ridging) is an essential activity in potato crop care. This may encourage the development of additional tubers preventing tubers growing just below the surface from producing chlorophyll and toxic solanine if exposed to light (green potatoes). Primary ridge is prepared at planting and it has a height of 8-12 cm above seed tuber. Secondary (final) ridge is prepared 2-4 days prior to emergence or by earthing up after emergence, before blooming (15-20 cm plant height). A good ridge has triangular shape with a height of 24-30 cm above furrow and a bottom of 45-50 cm width. Planting in pre-prepared ridges is also applied. Early potato needs ridges of smaller volume. If early potato is grown without cover, hilling at planting and prior to emergence should be avoided due to resulting in delayed ripening. Inter-row cultivation is used to improve soil structure and as an alternative or supplement to chemical weed control by herbicides. Potato is usually irrigated from the start of tuber set (budding) to 7-10 days prior to full development of tubers. Irrigation must be applied to the needs of potato thus little doses applied regularly are preferred. First dose is 40-60 mm followed by 3-4 x 30-50 mm doses (12-14 or 14-18 days of rotation on loose or medium-compact soils, respectively). In the case of drought rotation can be 1-5 days.

Skin set is complete (skin at apical end of tuber not removable with thumb). Early (new) potatoes are harvested when skin set is not yet complete (skin easily removable with thumb) and they reach a diameter of ca. 2.5 cm. Harvesting needs dry and rugged conditions. Harvesting must be avoided when pulp or internal temperatures of the tubers are below 8 C or above 18 C. Harvesting at low temperatures leads to bruising, while crops harvested at high temperatures are prone to tuber breakdown from bacterial soft rot and pythium. Long-term storage potential of potato can be increased by ensuring proper skin set on the tuber prior to harvest. Thickening of skin on maturation can be accelerated by topkilling the crop when the tubers reach the desired size. Topkilling involves spraying the crop with desiccants, or by flailing (mechanical removal of potato tops). Potatoes are lifted with a potato digger and then picked by hand, or harvested with a potato harvester. Potato can be stored under various conditions, such as clamps, storage boxes, containers, etc. Storage steps are the following: 1. Drying: max. 1-2 weeks 2. Curing/suberization (healing wounds occurring during harvest): 12-15 C, 92% air humidity, 10-14 days 3. Cooling down tubers: slow (0,5 C/day), 20-40 days, aeration is necessary 4.

Its selective breeding from the 'White Silesian' fodder beet was started by Franz Karl Achard in 1784, based on the discovery of the existence of a sugar in vegetables similar to that obtained from sugarcane by Andreas Sigismund Marggraf in 1747. By the beginning of the 19th century, sugar beet contained ca. 5-6% sucrose. Achard opened the world's first beet sugar factory in 1801, at Cunern in \n",

Sugar beet has a raw sugar (sucrose) content of 14-18% (up to ca. 23%). White sugar content is ca. 80% of raw sugar content. Amino-nitrogen decreases the amount of sugar extracted, it should be 20-50 mg/100g root. High concentrations of potassium and sodium in soluble ash (above 0.5-0.6%) can hinder the crystallization of sugar. It takes about 9 sugar beets to make 1 kg of sugar. This corresponds to an area under cultivation of about 1 square metre. Sugar beet is primarily used for the production of white crystallized sugar (sucrose) and its derivatives such as brown sugar, powdered sugar, beverages and bioethanol or biobutanol. By-products of harvesting (crown and head) and processing (wet or dried/pressed pulp or cossettes, as well as molasses) can be used as livestock fodder supplement. Other utilization of crown and head is as green manure, while molasses is used in the production of spirits, sugar-syrup, substitution of honey, as well as in the treatment of road surfaces. Figure 26 Cross section of sugar beet (left and right) and fodder beet (centre) roots Botanical characteristics Sugar beet is a biennial plant. It consists of four parts: leaves, head, neck and root. In the first year (vegetative stage), it has three types of leaves (A, B and C type) emerging successively. The head (epicotyl) and leaves are also called tops or haulm. The neck (hypocotyl) contains neither leaves nor lateral roots. The root is a taproot, the shape of which is conical, turnip-like, whitish to light yellow in color. It has two longitudinal bud furrows on opposite sides. Its tail-like end (<1 cm) usually breaks off when the root is harvested. The number of the concentric rings of vascular tissue alternating with storage parenchyma is 9-12 in sugar beet (Figure 26). The angular flowering stalk elongates (bolts) from the root in the second growing season (reproductive stage), it grows ca. 1.2-1.8 metres tall. At the base of the stem large petiolate leaf develops, further up the stem there are less petiolate, finally sessile leaves developing. Secondary shoots forming a series of indeterminate racemes develop at the leaf axils. Flowers are small, sessile and occur singly or in clusters. Multigerm beet fruit is formed by an aggregation of two or more flowers. It is a cluster of nutlets enclosed within the swollen corky perianth-bases (Figure 27).

Diploid (occasionally tripolid) hybrids of sugar beet are cultivated worldwide. Hybrids can posses the following resistance traits: - Cr: Cercospora resistant - Rt (Rz): Rhizomania tolerant - Rt (Rz) + Cr: Rhizomania tolerant and Cercospora resistant - Rt (Rz) + Me: Rhizomania tolerant and powdery mildew resistant - Rt (Rz) + Rc: Rhizomania tolerant and Rhizoctonia resistant According to the extended BBCH-scale, sugar beet has the following principal phenological growth stages: 0: Germination 1: Leaf development (youth stage) 3: Rosette growth (crop cover) 4: Development of harvestable vegetative plant parts (beet root) 5: Inflorescence emergence (2nd year of growth) 6: Flowering 7: Development of fruit 8: Ripening 9: Senescence Sugar beet is cross-pollinated. Figure 27 Sugar beet Environmental requirements Sugarbeet is a temperate zone crop. The growing period is 170-200 days long. It prefers moderately warm temperature during the growing season (effective heat unit: 2400-2600 C). Sugar beet requires 460-600 mm of rainfall to raise an average crop. Most of the water is needed during the stage of intensive tuber development. Sunshine of long duration but not of great intensity is an important factor in the successful cultivation of sugar beets. Sugar beet germinates at 4 C (15-20 days). Until leaf canopy completely covers soil surface, sugar beet requires gradually increasing temperature (10-12 C) and moderate precipitation. In the stage of root and leaf development, a temperature ranging from 15 to \n",

            " 7721 C is most favorable. For sugar accumulation in the last part of first year development moderate warm days (up to 17 C) and cool nights (ca. 12 C) are essential. Frost tolerance is -2-3 C in the early, while -5-7 C in the late stages of development. Sugar beet has the highest requirements for soil. The soil must be of homogenous structure, have a deep tilth, contain a large supply of nutrients, be rich in humus, have the property of retaining a great deal of moisture. It has a pH optimum of 6.5-7.3. Generous crops are grown in sandy soil as well as in heavy loams, while the ideal soil is a sandy loam. Cernozems, brown forest soils and meliorated meadow soils are among the best ones. Eroded, rocky, heterogenous, gritty soils, shifting sand, shallow tilth, weedy areas should be avoided. Cultivation Sugarbeet has special requirements for forecrops. It must be harvested in the summer, must not leave much residual nitrogen, require potassium, leave herbicide residues. The best are small-grain cereals, especially winter wheat and barley. Rotation is 4 years to avoid sugarbeet nematode (Heterodera schahtii) contamination. Sugarbeet can be followed e.g. by spring barley, winter wheat, maize, peas and hemp. Sugar beet requires deeply cultivated, sufficiently settled soil with a compact base and a friable, crumbly structued upper layer. Fall tillage should match to soil type, previous crop residue present, and be compatible with soil conservation requirements. Moldboard and chisel plows, disks and field cultivators all can be successfully used for primary fall tillage. Deep plowing of 32-36 cm or subsoiling at 40-50 cm, possibly combined with ploughing are usually applied. Spring tillage should be kept to a minimum. It must preserve seedbed moisture and reduce the chance of wind damage to weak sugarbeet seedlings as they emerge. The seedbed should be level, shallow and firm to allow good seed to soil contact. Common tillage tools are light harrows, multiweeders, and combination Danish tine, harrow, rolling basket tillage tool systems. Seedbed must be prepared ca. 5 cm deep. Planting should follow spring tillage as quickly as possible (ca. 24 hours) to prevent seedbed drying. Sugarbeets have been successfully planted with no-till, with strip tillage in previous crop residues, and other reduced tillage systems, too.

Sugarbeet is planted with precision row crop planters. Sugarbeets may be planted to thin to a final stand (dense, loose) or space planted to a desired final plant population. Fruits are polished, seeds are pelleted and coated prior to sowing. If thinning is necessary, it must be performed at the stage of 5-6 leaves. Inter-row cultivation is used to improve soil structure and as an alternative or supplement to chemical weed control by herbicides. Irrigation is essential in areas with very low rainfall but should not be started prior to the developmental stage of 4-6 leaves. Doses of 40-80 mm water must be applied 4 times during the root development stage.

It means a raw sugar content of 16-18%. Sugarbeets are harvested in the autumn, from September to October or November. It needs a specialized set of machines. Currently topper/harvesters operating in one round are applied most frequently. Foliage is removed from the beet root by a mechanical defoliator prior to lifting. It can also be performed by cutting the beet head. Immediately following defoliation, sugarbeet lifter-loader harvesters pull beets from the soil and load them on trucks. The harvesters remove most of the soil from the beets prior to loading them on trucks. \n",

Its growing area is 24,843,104.00 ha, the global production is 37,449,403.00 tons (FAO, 2012). Sunflower oil is used by food industry (cooking oil, margarine, etc.), cosmetic industry (creams, etc.), textile industry, soap, paint, plastic production. It is a valuable raw material of biodiesel production. By-products of oil-extraction (sunflower meal of 34-46%, cake of 48-50% protein) are food for livestock (especially for ruminants). Sunflower seed is used for human consumption (raw, baked, roasted, salted or not salted) or as birds food. Hulls are used for the production of fodder starch and furfurol, as well as biomass for energy production. The plant produces latex to be used as nonallergenic rubber, the fibres of the stem can be used in paper production. The whole plant can be utilized as green forage and silage (protein content of silage: 14-16%). Sunflower can be used as green manure as well as for phytoremediation. It is a valuable honey plant (20-30 kg honey/ha) and some genotypes are used as ornamental plants. High oil sunflower contains 46-54% (up to 57-59%), while confectionary genotypes 32-38% oil. The oil is of high nutritional value (due to high linoleic acid content), as well as stable with good storage life (due to lack of linolenic acid). Oil of high-oleic (HO) genotypes contains ca. 82% oleic acid. This type of oil exhibits greater stability and resistance to rancidity over time, as well as it can be used as biodiesel, too. Sunflower seed is a source of dietary fiber, some amino acids (especially tryptophan), vitamin E, several B vitamins (especially thiamine, pantothenic acid and folic acid). It is rich in cholesterol-lowering phytosterols, in protein (9-24%), as well as in minerals including magnesium and copper. Botanical characteristics Sunflower has a substantial but often shallow root system. Tap root can go up to 3 m depth with a large lateral spread of feeder roots the majority of which remains near the soil surface (up to 50 cm). The stem is robust, circular in section, ca. 3-6 cm in diameter with rough hairs and slight longitudinal ridges. It has a woody exterior filled with a stiff white pith. The stem height is 1-3 m. Varieties and hybrids of high seed-oil content are usually \n",

            " 82 shorter with smaller heads. Branching is unfavorable in crops grown for seed. Leaves are opposite on the lower stem (first three pairs) and alternate above. They are large, ovate and cordate carried on long petioles. The inflorescence is a disc-shaped capitulum (head) borne terminally on the main stem and branches. Its size is usually 10-30 cm in diameter. Flowers are of two types. The brightly colored, yellow, sterile ray (ligulate) flowers resembling petals are ordered in an outer row. Brown or purplish, fertile disc flowers are arranged spirally in the centre of the head. Their number is 600-1200 (Figure 28). The fruit (sunflower seed) is an achene of various colors: black, black with grey or white/light-grey stripe, dark grey with white/light-grey stripe, grey with white or grey stripe, white. Dark hull is usually related with high seed-oil content while light and striped hull with birdseed and confectionary purposes. Dark seeds are usually smaller, their 1000 grain content being 70-80 g. Confectionary seeds have a 1000 grain weight of 100-120 g. Figure 28 Sunflower According to the extended BBCH-scale, sunflower has the following principal phenological growth stages: 0: Germination 1: Leaf development 3: Stem elongation 5: Inflorescence emergence 6: Flowering 7: Development of fruit 8: Ripening 9: Senescence Sunflower bud exhibits heliotropism: during the day, its faces move from east to west, while at night they return to an eastward orientation. In the flowering stage sunflower is not heliotropic anymore, heads are locked facing east. Flowers are protandrous and cross-fertilized, honey-bees being the almost exclusive pollinators. Flowers mature progressively from the periphery to the center of the disc: 2-4 rows at one time. The centre of origin of sunflower is in North America (32-52 Northern Latitude: Arkansas, North and South Dakota, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska). H. annuus belongs to the family Asteraceae and it is diploid (2n=34). Nowadays primarily hybrid sunflowers are cultivated worldwide, however varieties can also be found especially among confectionary and ornamental genotypes. \n",

            " 83Environmental requirements Sunflower is grown in semi-arid regions of the world. Its effective heat unit is 1900-2500 (3000) C. It tolerates both low and high temperatures. Sunflower germinates at 6-7 C (confectionary varieties) or 7-8 C (high oil varieties). Seedlings in the cotyledon stage can survive temperatures down to -5 C. At later stages freezing temperatures may injure the crop. Temperatures below -2 C can kill maturing sunflower plants. Optimum temperatures for growth are 21 to 25 C, but temperatures from 18 to 32 C have little effect on productivity. Extremely high temperatures lower oil percentage, seed fill and germination. Regarding transpiration coefficient (transpired g H2O/g DM) of 577, sunflower is similar to wheat, soybean, fieldbean, oat, and rape, while it is 349 for corn and 34 for sorghum. It has, however a medium water requirement of 470-550 mm. It is drought tolerant owing to its extensively branched taproot, penetrating to 2 m. Maximum water requirement can be detected between the formation of disc primordia and the start of flowering (ca. 40%, 200 mm), as well as after flowering, between seed filling and oil accumulation (25-30%, 120-150 mm). For initial development warm and rainy, for flowering warm and humid (22-24 C), for seed filling and ripening dry, moderately warm (18-20 C) and sunny weather is beneficial. In the last period 10 rainy days per month are optimal. Humid, rainy weather stimulates the occurrance of disc diseases. Sunflower grows in a wide range of soils from sands to clays. Best are medium compact loamy soils of good temperature and water management and good general condition. Its pH optimumis 6.5-7.5. Primarily cernozems but also brown forest soils, meadow and alluvial soils, humic sand and improved alkaline soils are preferred. Sunflower tolerates soils of inferior quality (eroded, shallow tilth, low humus sand, alkaline, etc.) but depression in yield quantity and quality can be expected. Cultivation The best forecrops of sunflower are winter and spring cereals, as well as sweet corn. Forecrops of medium quality are silage maize, corn, sorghums, temporary grasses. Pulses and legumes are inferior forecrops due to enriching soil in nitrogen that increases disease-susceptability and is not utiled efficiently. Tobacco, hemp, flax, tomato and other crops susceptible for grey and white mold, as well as sugarbeet, potato, chicory and sunchoke leaving contagious residues must be avoided two years prior to sunflower. Rotation is 5 years, in the case of broomrape infection 6-7 years. It can be followed by maize, spring barley, oat, sorghum, annual forages and winter wheat. However, sunflower is not suitable as forecrop for sugarbeet and potato due to its high water consumption and causing weediness, as well as for pulses and legumes due to inhibiting the formation of root nodules for a while.

The global production is 65,058,240.00 tons (FAO, 2012). Rapeseed oil (00 genotypes) is used by food industry (cooking oil, margarine, etc.), cosmetic industry (creams, etc.), textile industry, soap, paint, plastic and leather production or processing, production of coolants and slushes in heavy industry. It is a valuable raw material of biodiesel production (regulation: oleic acid: 51-80%, linolenic acid: 2-10%). In developing countries it is still used for lighting. By-products of oil-extraction (00 genotypes) are food for livestock (especially for ruminants). The whole plant can be utilized as green forage and for grazing. Rapeseed can be used as green manure, furthermore it is an excellent forecrop (early harvest, little stem and root residues, etc.). Table 46 Fatty acid composition of canola oil Rapeseed has a crude oil content of 46-48% (traditional genotypes) or 42-44% (00 genotypes). Traditional rapeseed genotypes has a high (>45%) erucic acid and glucosinolate (>150 mol/g) content. Erucic acid (22:1) is considered to cause severe health problems such as liver degeneration, nephritis, myocarditis and decreased growth. Glucosinolates are sharp-tasting and maybe poisonous (goiter inducing effect) compounds inhibiting the utilization of rapeseed meal for feeding. Canola or Double Zero (00) Rapeseed has 0-2% erucic acid and <150 mol/g glucosinolate content making it suitable especially for human consumption, animal feeding and biodiesel purposes. The fatty acid composition of canola oil is shown in Table 46. Botanical characteristics Rapeseed has a tap root system of ca. 2 m in depth, with secondary roots growing outward and downward from the tap root. After emergence, the plant quickly establishes a rosette with older, bigger leaves at the base, younger leaves developing in the centre. Canola plants can produce 9 to 30 leaves on the main stem depending on variety and growing conditions. B. napus plants grow 75-175 cm tall and have a distinct main stem with from four to six secondary branches (Figure 29). Canola flowers are bisexual and develop in terminal racemes. The diagonally opposite, yellow petals form a cross. Seeds develop in a 2-celled, elongated capsule (silique or pod). Between 15 and 25 seeds are produced per pod. Its 1000 grain weight is 3.5-6 g. The centre of origin of rapeseed is the Mediterranean basin (Southwest Europe, North Africa). The rapeseed belongs to the family Cruciferae. B. napus is an amphidiploid Compound Family % of total Oleic acid -9 61% Linoleic acid -6 21% Alpha-linolenic acid -3 9-11% Saturated fatty acids 7% Palmitic acid 4% Stearic acid 2% Trans fat 0.4% \n",

Fertilization usually results from self-pollination. Outcrossing occurs at levels of ca. 30%. Environmental requirements Canola is adapted primarily to the cool extremes of the temperate zones. Optimum are the moderate warm and humid conditions. Minimum temperatures for growth is 8 C. Effective heat unit until blooming is 170-210 C. Rapeseed withstands frost to -18-22 C on dry soil and to -6-8 C on wet soil. Winter varieties are grown where snow covers or mild winters are common. Planting date has a dramatic effect on survival. Too early sowing results in excess growth leading to freezing out or suffocation. Too late sowing, however, can result small plants with thin root system which are threatened by the negative effects of freeze-thaw cycles of soils. Optimal overwintering can be expected at a developmental stage of a rosette with 8-10 leaves. Canola requires 400-500 mm precipitation with maximums at emergence, intensive growing and before flowering. At flowering humidity of 80% is preferred. Canola does best on medium textured, well drained, medium compact or loose soils. It is tolerant of a soil pH as low as 5.5 and saline conditions, optimum being 6.5. Best are \n",

Cultivation Rapeseed does not have special forecrop requirements; however crops harvested early, 4-6 weeks (15-20. July) prior to rapeseed sowing are preferred. Good forecrops are winter barley, early winter wheat, pea, winter and spring forage mixes, crimson clover, etc. Medium maturity winter wheat, spring barley, early potato and alfalfa broken up early can still be applied. Oat, legumes broken up late, and forecrops harvested after the end of July should be avoided. Rotation is 5 years. Rapeseed is one of the best forecrops of wheat. Following stubble clearing, primary tillage can be performed by ploughing (on wet soil, 20-25 cm depth) or disc harrowing (on dry soil, 10-13 cm depth). Primary tillage must be finished ca. 4 weeks prior to sowing. Seeding into a smooth, firm seedbed assures a uniform seeding depth and even emergence. Seedbed should be 1.5-3 cm deep and compact. Canola can be successfully established also with reduced and conservation tillage and direct seeding.

It reaches primary technical maturity at a seed moisture of 30-40%, pods are golden-yellow, seeds can be severed by finger pressure. To ensure uniform maturity, desiccants or growth regulators are usually applied at a seed moisture content of 25-30% which is followed by harvest in 5-7 or 14-18 days, respectively. Secondary technical maturity is reached at a seed moisture of 16-19%, pods are brown, seeds are black. Canola is harvested by direct combining. Seeds should be below 11(9-10)% moisture for long term storage. 2.4.3. Poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) Poppy (a.k.a. opium poppy) is utilized in several ways: food (alkaloid content <0.1%), industrial products (alkaloid-based medicines - alkaloid content >0.1% up to 10%; oil 40-56%; cosmetics, etc.), birds food, ornamental plant (flower or dry pod), etc. Poppy seeds are used as ingredient in foods, as traditional medicine, and they are pressed to yield poppyseed oil. Poppy straw (poppy capsule/poppy chaff/poppy head/poppy pod) is opium poppy harvested fully mature and dry, separated from the ripe seeds. Since the world patent of Jnos Kabay (1927) for the chemical process of extracting morphine from it, poppy straw became the major source of many opiates and other alkaloids, such as morphine (0.15-1.8% dry pod weight, d.p.w.), codeine (0.05-0.6% d.p.w.), thebaine, papaverine, narcotine/nascopine and narcotoline. Poppy straw is occasionally a source of illegal morphine processed into illegal heroin, while raw opium is gained from latex leaking from shallow cuts in the immature seed pods. Botanical characteristics Poppy has a tap root system of ca. 1 m in depth, with a low number of side roots which get thick near the soil surface thus giving support to the plant. The stem can be 50-150 cm tall. The stem and the leaves are strongly glaucous, giving a greyish-green appearance, and sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The leaves are lobed and clasp the stem at the base. The flowers are up to 120 mm in diameter. They have normally four white, mauve or red petals, sometimes with dark markings at the base. The fruit is a rounded capsule with 12-18 radiating stigmatic rays on the top (Figure 30). The kidney-shaped seeds are of various color, e.g. blue, brown, black or white. Its 1000 grain weight is 0.25-0.6 g. The seeds contain very low levels of opiates, compared to the seed pod and straw. All parts of the plant exude white latex when wounded. The centre of origin of poppy is the southern and eastern part of the Mediterranean basin, the refion of the Aegean Sea. Poppy belongs to the family Papaveraceae and it is diploid (2n=22). Poppy has several subspecies or varieties/cultivars. They are different in the color of the flower, in number and shape of petals, in number of flowers and fruits, in number of seeds, in color of seeds, in production of opium, etc. \n",

Figure 30 Opium poppy Environmental requirements Poppy has a growing period of 120-160 days or 250-270 days if sown in spring or autumn, respectively. The effective heat unit requirement is 2000-2200 C. It germinates at 3-5 C. Below -3 C it will be damaged. At stem elongation it needs 16-18 C and it has the highest nutrient and water requirement at this stage. At flowering and ripening 21-23 C is preferred. During the whole growing period a gradual increase in temperature is optimal. Poppy needs 280-300 mm water with maximums at growth stages of leaf rosette stem elongation as well as budding early flowering. Excess of water after flowering can result in the cease of growth and development. Poppy needs much light, >20,000 lux for flower development. The length and strength of insolation increases alkaloid content in poppy straw. Poppy is sensitive for strong wind that can remove loose soil from growng seedlings as well as for sand-blast. Poppy does best on early warming, medium textured or looser humic sand, cernozem or brown forest soils. It prefers pH 7-8 to pH 6. Loose sand, hard meadow and acidic (pH <6) soils should be avoided. Cultivation Small grain cereals and potato are the best forecrops of poppy. It can be efficiently grown after rapeseed, mustard and sugar beet if weediness is considered. Maize, sunflower and perennial legumes should be avoided as forecrops. Rotation is 4-6 years. Poppy is one of the best forecrops of winter cereals. The tillage system resembles those applied for winter or spring cereals. The main aspect is the preparation of a shallow (1-1.5 cm) and compact seedbed. \n",

The various parts or organs of the plant can be utilized for a wide range of purposes. Bast fibers are used in textile industry (sacks, cordage, canvas, clothes, etc.), paper industry, building industry (fibreboards, insulation blocks, concrete blocks with hemp, etc.) and composite, hemp plastic materials for car interiors, sink basins, etc. Hemp hurds (shives) are used in building industry (fibreboards, insulation, stuccos/plasters, etc.), as well as for animal bedding, mulch, compost for mushroom cultures, etc. Leaves are used for animal bedding and compost, the cellular liquid of green plants as solvent. The whole plant can be used for the production of alcohol fuel or as biomass for energy production. Hemp seed has a high (30-33%) content of drying oil. This can be used for the purposes described at oilseed crops, including biodiesel, while the seed cake as animal food, protein powder, gluten-free flour or beer-additive. Hemp has several agrotechnical advantages, too. Because of its height, dense foliage and its high planting density as a crop, it effectively kills tough weeds. Furthermore, it has few pests, its deep root system loosens the soil and leaves it in good condition. Botanical characteristics Hemp is an annual plant with a deep taproot system and is capable of very rapid growth (4-6 cm/day). Fibre hemp plants grow to 2-4 m tall without branching (Figure 31). The stem has an outer bark that contains the long, tough bast fibers. Bast (skin) fibres are collected from the phloem (bast). They support the conductive cells of the phloem and provide strength to the stem. They are similar in length to soft wood fibers and are very low in lignin content. Hemp rope, textiles and clothing is made from these fibers. The core contains the hurds or shives (short fibers) similar to hard wood fibers and these are used for building, particleboard (MDF), pet bedding, etc. Valuable fibres of the phloem must be separated from the xylem material (woody core). This process is called retting. Plants grown for grain production may branch and reach heights of 2-3 m. Figure 31 Hemp \n",

Development of fruit Hemp is dioecious, however monoecious genotypes were are bred. Besides varieties, hybrids are also cultivated. Besides dioecious hybrids, unisexual hybrids are also in use. This case the pure female F1 originating from a monoecious x dioecious crossing is used for seed production while F2 is the fibre producing generation. Male hemp is different from the female individuals in several characteristics: it grows faster, its growing period is 5-6 weeks shorter, its stem is taller and thinner, it has higher fibre content and better fibre quality due to the higher percentage of primary fibres. The centre of origin of hemp is Centre Asia. From here it spread to north (Northern hemp and Central Russian hemp) as well as to south (Meditarranean hemp). Hemp belongs to the family Cannabinaceae and it is diploid (2n=20). Cannabis sativa L. var. vulgaris (common hemp) has a THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) content of <0.2%. C. sativa var. indica (Indian hemp) has a high THC content of >0.2% (up to 20%). C. sativa var. ruderalis is wild hemp with a low THC content. Environmental requirements Hemp has a growing period of 110-115 day and a heat unit requirement of 1800-2000 C (fibre) or 2500-3000 C (seed). Minimum tempreature for germination is 1-2 C (optimum: 5-10 C). It withstands frost to -5 C. Till the closing of leaf canopy 10-15 C, while in the big period of growth (summer months) 20-25 C are optimal. Sunlight may affect fibre quality. The dense population of fibre hemp requires much water (500-700 mm) but it utilizes water efficiently. Maximum water requirement is during the intensive growth. Hemp requires well drained, loam soil with high humus content, deep tilth and pH above 6.0 (optimum: pH 7.0-7.5). Higher clay content of the soil results in lower yield of grain or fibre. Hemp is very sensitive to soil compaction. Young plants are very sensitive to wet soils or flooding during the first 3 weeks or until growth reaches the fourth internode (ca. 30 cm tall). Poorly structured, drought-prone sandy soils as well as those with a shallow tilth should be avoided. Table 52 Nutrient requirement of hemp Nutrient uptake to 1 ton of yield N: 10 kg/t P2O5: 4 kg/t K2O: 20 kg/t CaO: 16 kg/t MgO: 6 kg/t Cultivation Best forecrops of hemp are small grain cereals and other crops harvested early and leaving much moisture in soil. Sunflower, flax and other water-demanding crops should be avoided. A rotation of 4 years is advised. Hemp requires a deep tillage. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 52 and 53, respectively. In general, the effective ingredient doses are those applied for wheat: 12-150 kg/ha N, 70-100 kg/ha P and 100-120 kg/ha K. Chloride inhibits fibre formation thus K2SO4 should be used instead of KCl. \n",

Male hemp reaches technical maturity 20-25 days before the female. Technical maturity is when male plants are in 50% flowering while pollen is shed and inflorescenses just appeared on female plants. Defoliation can be applied in the case of big amount of leaves. It is followed by harvest in 8-10 days. Traditionally, hemp is harvested by hand, by a special cutter-binder and a stabile baler, or fully mechanized by a hemp-harvester. After cutting (2-3 cm above ground), hemp stalks are lieing in windrows for several days. Stalks are gathered and tied into bundles (diameter: 20-25 cm) by a machine. Bundles are shocked (40 bundle/shock), finally compressed and baled (80 bundles/bale, 16% moisture). 2.5.2. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) Besides the usage of dried tobacco leaves in tobacco industry (cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, flavored shisha tobacco, as well as snuff, chewing tobacco and dipping tobacco), tobacco alkaloids are utilized in chemical industry for the production e.g. pesticides. The most important alkaloid of tobacco, nicotine causes death already in an amount of 0.04-0.06 g. Tobacco genotypes of good quality contains 0.5-1.5% in leaf dry matter. Cultivars of crude leaf structure contain 1.6-3.0% while N. rustica >5% nicotine. Nornicotine is a substitute of nicotine with milder effect, while anabasine is more poisonous than nicotine and is used as insecticide. Carbohydrates (except for starch) have a crucial positive role in the determination of quality and aroma. They give 40-50% of dry matter. Organic acids (e.g. citric acid giving 0.6-9.2% of total organic acids) bind a part of nicotine thus improving the flavor of smoke. Potassium improves drought resistance of the plants carbohydrate synthesis in leaves and contributes to better burning. Calcium in high proportion has negative effect due to binding organic acids. High phosphorous and \n",

            " 96 chloride levels provide both negative burning and taste characteristics. High protein and nitrate content decrease burning characteristics and smoke quality. In tobacco of good quality nitrogen level is <8%. Tobacco has various types according to their botany and utilization: - Brightleaf tobacco (\"Virginia tobacco\") - most widely used worldwide, especially suitable for artificial drying - Burley tobacco - even ripening of leaves thus the whole plant is harvested - Cavendish - more a process of curing and a method of cutting tobacco than a type; it is used to bring out the natural sweet taste in the tobacco - Criollo tobacco - primarily used in the making of cigars - Turkish tobacco - a sun-cured, highly aromatic, small-leafed variety - Perique tobacco - used as a component in many blended pipe tobaccos - Wild tobacco (Nicotiana rustica) extreme high nicotine content (>5%). - others: Aromatic fire-cured tobacco, Dokha tobacco, Shade tobacco, White burley, Y1 strain Botanical characteristics Tobacco has a strong tap root system but during the collection of seedlings the original roots are damaged and a shallow system of adventitious roots develops after transplanting. Plant height ranges from 90 to 240 cm. Tobacco plants can produce between 10 and 40 leaves. They vary in size from 15 to 100 cm, in shape from long, narrow to broadly ovate, in angle from upright to horizontal, and in color (Figure 32). Due to their differences in quality, the leaves are divided into groups based on the harvesting insertion (from bottom to top): primings (P, 6%), lugs (X, 14%), middle leaves or cutters (C, 28%), upper leaves (B, 42%) and tips (10%). Tobacco has a terminal raceme panicle. The color of flowers vary from pink and purplish to white. Flowering order is from top to bottom. The fruits are capsules. Seeds are dark or light brown, their 1000 grain weight is the smallest among crops: 0.09 g. Figure 32 Tobacco The centre of origin of tobacco is Central and South America. It belongs to the family Solananceae. N. tabacum is an amphiploid species (2n=48) likely resulting from an interspecific cross between N. sylvestris (2n=24) and N. tomentosiformis (2n=24). \n",

            " 97The principal growth stages of tobacco based on the BBCH scale: 0. Germination 1. Leaf development (0. seedling; 1. field plant) 2. Formation of side shoots (0. ground suckers; 1. upper stalk/head suckers) 3. Stem elongation and crop cover (0. stem elongation seedlings; 1. stem elongation field plant; 2. crop cover within rows; 3. crop cover between rows) 4. Development of harvestable vegetative plant parts (i.e. ripening of leaves) 5. Inflorescence emergence 6. Flowering (main stem) 7. Development of fruits (i.e. seed capsules) 8. Ripening of seeds 9. Termination of crop (harvesting and curing: 0. leaf harvesting phase; 1. colouring phase; 2. lamina drying phase; 3. mid-vein drying phase) Environmental requirements Tobacco, due to its origin requires warm conditions throughout its growing period. Effective heat unit is 3000-3500 C (in temperate climate 2600-2700 C of this on the field). It germinates at 13-15 C (optimum: 25 C). Daily average temperature should be 20-22 C while daily temperature difference must be <10 C. It is sensitive for frost, -3-4 C deteriorates yield. At the beginning of development temperature, in the final part of development sunshine has decisive role. Cool weather results in big leaves and poor quality while warm and dry weather generates smaller leaves of good quality in the second half of the growing period. Water supply has an important role in the determination of leaf quality through turgor pressure. Furthermore, in dry years nicotine level becomes higher. Virginia and Burley tobaccos require 350-450 mm water, Burley exhibiting slightly higher needs. Air humidity in excess during leaf development can contribute to the occurrence of diseases. Wind, shower and hail can cause severe damages on leaves. During maturation sunshine and warm, at harvest dry and warm weather is preferred. Tobacco prefers well aerated, loose soils of deep tilth. Virginia tobacco has a pH optimum of 5.5-7.2, pH optimum of Burley is 7-8. On compact soils leaves will have coarse while on loose soils fine-textured leaves. High nitrogen content is unfavorable. Cultivation Tobacco does not have special requirements for forecrops. It can be cultivated in monoculture for 2 years. Best forecrops are wheat, barley and rye. Forage mixes, lupines and sweet clover are of mediocre quality. Perennial legumes, pulses, sorghum, maize, sunflower, sugar beet and melone are bad forecrops. Among others, potato, pepper, tomato, eggplant, hemp, flax and cucumber should be avoided. Tobacco itself is good forecrop for small grain cereals and other non-relative plants. Basic tillage steps are the same as described for other spring crops. Deep tillage is not necessary. Ridge planting is also common. It prevents root rot and discoloration of lower leaves, and improves harvestability of them. It should be 30-35 cm high at a row distance of 110 cm. Basic fertilization data can be found in Table 54. In general, the effective ingredient doses are those applied for wheat: 30-50 kg/ha N, 60-80 kg/ha P and 180-200 kg/ha K. Chloride decreases quality and burning characteristics, thus K2SO4 should be used instead of KCl. Tobacco is sown in the middle of February, into a special medium composed of turf (50%), farmyard manure (25%) and river sand (25%) in cold frames, hot bed or plastic tunnel greenhouse. Seed rate is 0.1 g/m2 (= 900-1000 seeds/m2) with seeds of a 1000 grain weight of 0.09 g. Soil must be wet in a depth of 20-25 cm. For germination 13-15 C, for further \n",

Hardening of seedlings must be startd 8-10 days prior to transplanting by aeration and lower level of irrigation intensity. In the last two days intensive irrigation is needed to decrease root damage. Seedlings of 5-7 leaves are transplanted after 4-5 weeks of growing. For manual transplanting sedlings of 10-15 cm, for mechanical transplanting seedlings of 15-18 cm are preferred. Ca. 50-70 m2 of nursery area is needed for the transplanting of 1 ha. Seedlings can also be grown in trays filled with compost and floating on water. It is a more sophisticated technique resulting better quality seedlings with strong root system. However, it is more expensive requiring much investment. The crucial step of this method is the trimming of seedlings four times to give a homogeneous population, to strengthen plantlets and delay transplanting. Basic data of transplanting can be found in Table 55. Seedlings wasted away must be supplemented in 7 days. In dry conditions, tobacco must be irrigated from the height of 50 cm to flowering. Inter-row cultivation (4 times) is used to improve soil structure and as an alternative or supplement to chemical weed control by herbicides. Tobacco crop needs to be topped prior to the development of flowers to improve quality and yield. Only 1-2 leaves are removed in well developed population, 2-3 in the case of late transplanting and 4-5 in supplementary populations. Lateral shoots developing after topping must be removed manually or chemically. In the case of matur plants and rainy weather they need not be removed.

            " 99Harvesting and curing Tobacco reaches technical maturity when the leaf surface is bright, yellowish green, the mid-vein of leaves gets lighter and it breaks snapping. Tobacco is harvested in ca. 5 rounds by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. The leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner will involve the serial harvest of a number of \"primings,\" beginning with the volado leaves near the ground, working to the seco leaves in the middle of the plant, and finishing with the potent ligero leaves at the top. Leaf yield is 1.5 tons/ha. Burley tobacco ripens homogeneously thus the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife. It is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick and hung in a curing barn. After being harvested, tobacco needs to be cured to prepare the leaf for consumption. Curing methods vary with the type of tobacco grown, and tobacco barn design varies accordingly. Air-cured tobacco is hung in well-ventilated barns and allowed to dry at 28-30 C, 76-80% humidity over a period of four to eight weeks. Cigar and burley tobaccos are air cured. Flue curing is followed in the production of high grade cigarette type tobacco. Tobacco is cured under artificial heat in flue curing barns. Leaf moisture content is reduced from 80% to 20-25(16-18)%. The steps are: 1. Yellowing of leaves - 32-36 C, 36-48 hours, 86-90% humidity 2. Fixing of colour - 40-45 C, 16-24 hours, 40-45% humidity 3. Drying of lamina - 57-65 C, 24-36 hours, 30% humidity 4. Drying of mid-vein - 70-75 C, 24-36 hours, 20% humidity 5. Cooling, softening - 20 C, 16-20 hours, 20-35% humidity Other curing methods are fire and sun curing. 2.5.3.

Alfalfa or lucerne (Medicago sativa L., Medicago varia Martyn) Alfalfa is the most valuable, protein-rich forage legume which has a broad spectrum of utilization possibilities. It has a positive effect on soil fertility (draining and aggregate forming effect of root system, enriching in N etc.). Botanical characteristics Alfalfa is a widely grown perennial legume with a woody yet narrow crown, tap roots and flowers borne on racemes or spikes in various shades of blue, purple, cream and white. Pods range in shape from sickle to spiraled with one or more coils. Leaflets are 9.5 mm to 3.2 cm long, obovate and sharply toothed towards the apex. Traditional varieties are trifoliate, however an increasing number of multifoliolate varieties have been developed. The erect stems usually reach 30 to 90 cm (Figure 33). Figure 33 Alfalfa Phenological growth stages of alfalfa: Vegetative phase 0 Early vegetative: Stem length 15 cm, no buds, flowers,or seedpods 1 Mid-vegetative: Stem length 16-30 cm, no buds, flowers or seedpods 2 Late vegetative Stem length 31 cm, no buds, flowers or seedpods Flower bud development 3 Early bud: 1-2 nodes with buds, no flowers or seedpods 4 Late bud: 3 nodes with buds, no flowers or seedpods Floweringphase 5 Early flower: node with 1 open flower, no seedpods 6 Late flower: 2 nodes with open flowers, no seedpods Seedproduction 7 Early seedpod: 3 nodes with green seedpods 8 Late seedpod: 4 nodes with green seedpods 9 Ripe seedpod: Nodes with mostly brown mature seedpods Alfalfa is 85-95% open-pollinating, fertilized primarily by wild bees. \n",

            " 101Its primary center of origin is the region east from Kaspian Sea, the secondary being the Mediterranean. Alfalfa and all other legumes belong to the family Fabaceae/Leguminosae. Cultivated alfalfa is tetraploid (2n=4x=32), its wild relatives are diploid (2n=16). Environmental requirements Alfalfa tolerates relatively well climate extremities. It is winter-hardy (-25 C without snow-cover). Minimum temperature for germination is 2-3 C. To achieve high yields it requires 600-800 mm precipitation (or supplement by irrigation). Alfalfa does best on semi-cohesive soils with a pH of 6.5 or above, containing a high level of plant nutrients. Alfalfa is sensitive to excess soil water or the lack of good aeration. Surface water should not be allowed to stand more than 2 4 hours during hot weather or 48 hours during lower temperatures. Physiological stresses that may affect alfalfa plant appearance: soil pH outside of neutral range, poor drainage and limited moisture (particularly tap rooted types). Cultivation Small grain cereals (winter wheat and barley, spring barley) harvested prior to mid-July are the best forecrops. Legumes must be avoided. Rotation should not be shorter than 3-4 years. Alfalfa requires a deeply cultivated root zone. A perfect seedbed should be firm to reduce air pockets, fine to obtain an even covering of seed, level with no places where water stands, and free from weeds that compete with seedlings for moisture and plant nutrients. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 56 and 57, respectively.

There are limits, but plants recover from extremely dry periods. Production suffers, but the crop survives. Alfalfa can be a good crop for irrigators with limited water supplies. Irrigation is most effective in the 1-2. years, at 10-15 cm aftermath. A possible irrigation order: 2. aftermath: 50-70 mm, 3. aftermath: 70-80 mm, 4. aftermath: 50-60 mm, 5. aftermath: 40-50 mm, out of season: 60-80 mm, total: 200-250 (300) mm/season.

Quality depends on the phonological phase of alfalfa. Hay It is the oldest method of conservation. In the course of the drying process, from the green material of 78-82% moisture content hay of 84% dry matter content will be produced. If dried on the field, main sources of loss are the falling of leaves and the decrease in -carotene content. Alfalfa flour (green flour) This conservation method preserves the green material quality the best. Direct-cut green material is dried at 700-900 C to 90% dry matter content, followed by grinding. If cut and wilted in the field, material of 70% moisture content goes to the dryer. Conservation by fermentation (alfalfa silage and haylage) Alfalfa is hard to be fermented (high protein content, building of lots of alkalic intermedier compounds etc.). Alfalfa silage Chop size of 2.5 mm is optimal, initial moisture content of chopped green material is 78-82%. Additives (e.g. corn semolina, artificial compounds) can be applied to help fermentation. Alfalfa haylage In general, cut green material is let be wilted (40-50% dry matter) in the field prior to chopping and fermenting. Main aspects for planning the cutting order: - The two cuts of spring-sown alfalfa cultivated without irrigation are best for hay preparation in the first year. From the next year on, first cuts must be harvested before lodging starts, indepent from the development stage. First cut gives the highest \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 103percentage (35-50%) of the yearly yield. For hay-making summer cuts are the best, especially those harvested at flowering. The time period between harvests usually ranges from 30 to 40 days. In the last year of culture, when feeding is the primary aspect, harvesting dates and conservation methods can be chosen freely. In irrigated cultivation systems, there is a shorter period between cuts. On the other hand, giving out 60-80 mm water requires reasonable time. - The yield and the quality change according to the phenological phase. Highest yield can be achieved at the green bud flower bud phase but best quality is reached prior to this phase. On the border of these phases can be found the balanced stage when the worsening feeding quality is compensated by the increasing yield, and the highest amount of crude protein, -carotene and minerals can be harvested (Table 58). - In the second and succeeding seasons, the first harvest may be taken in the full bud stage, with other harvests being made at 10 percent bloom or before crown buds advance. The last growth must be allowed to grow and store the full amount of food reserves in the tap root before being killed by freezing temperatures. This provides the energy for the new plants to grow the following spring. Usually the last cut should be made no later than mid-September to mid-October. After complete killed by cold, the remaining frosted growth may be removed by harvesting or grazing.

White clover (Trifolium repens L.) White clover is primerily the component of grass-containing mixtures in the forage production on arable fields. It is useful for pasture, it withstands continuous grazing. Pure seeding is specifically for seed production purposes. In several regions it is utilized as greenmanure, too. It is easy to establish and has a good tolerance to wide pH range. Its yield as green forage is 3-7 t/ha/year. There two variety groups according to utilization: - Type 1: for establishing meadows and pastures or for overseeding, perennial, good winter hardiness, big mass with other components of the grassland - Type 2: for intensive systems, leafy, tall-growing type, producing high green mass (e.g. Ladino) Botanical characteristics White clover is a short to long lived perennial with a shallow tap root system and very small crowns. The primary stems are short with many internodes. Its flowers are usually white, though occasionally they are tinged with pink. The flowers of white clover are borne on peduncles that are somewhat longer than the petioles. There are 20 to 150 florets per head. Each leaf has 3 leaflets, and each leaflet usually has a v-shaped white mark in its centre. The leaflets are usually elliptical to heart shaped. The seeds of white clover are \n",

Birdsfoot trefoil pods are long and cylindrical, which turn brown to black and maturity (Figure 35). Its primary center of origin is the Mediterranean region. White clover is tetraploid (2n=4x=24) and outcrossing. Environmental requirements Birdsfoot trefoil prefers humid climate. It can be grown under dryer conditions as well, but this case irrigation is requered to achieve an acceptable yield. Primerily, it is grown on acidic soils, on soils of shallow fertile layer and on sandy soils. Cultivation It does not have specific preferences regarding forecrops. It is undemanding regarding root layer, but it requires a compact, homogenous seedbed of granular structure. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 62 and 63, respectively.

Kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria L.) Kidney vetch is a relatively young domesticated crop its growing started in the 19. century in Germany. It provides valuable feed even in areas where other legumes do not provide acceptable yield. Because of its bitter taste and hairy surface, the majority of livestock does not like it as green forage, excepting sheep. As hay, it is a tasty feed but it must be gradually introduced. It is a useful cover crop and green manure. Its yield is 3-8 t hay/ha \n",

It is adapted to areas with moderate summer temperatures and adequate moisture throughout the growing season. Unlike alfalfa, red clover will grow moderately well in slightly acid soils. However, maximum yields are obtained when soil pH is 6.0 or higher. Red clover, a short-lived perennial, usually produces two or three hay crops per year. It is characterized by rapid spring growth and low winter hardiness, which contributes to its short-lived nature. Botanical characteristics Two types of red clover exist: single and double cut. Single cut varieties are diploid (2n = 14) and tend to be smaller and later-flowering than the double cut varieties. Double cut varieties are tetraploid (2n = 28). It has a taproot system as well as many secondary branches. Red clover plants are composed of numerous leafy stems arising from a crown. Each leaf is made up of three oblong leaflets usually bearing a characteristic reddish, inverted V leaf markings in the centre of each leaflet. The heads are compact clusters of up to 125 flowers. Under favourable conditions, these flowers are 9 to 10.5 mm long. Flower colour varies from magenta to pale pink (Figure 37). Figure 37 Red clover Environmental requirements Its over-wintering ability is good, however, the periodical change of freezing and melting in the winter can cause root damage. It prefers moderately warm climate. In comparison to alfalfa, red clover is far less drought tolerant, but it is less demanding regarding soil quality. Cultivation Soil tests are required for proper determination of soil nutrient availability. In soils with a pH below 6.0, adding lime is essential to make the soil less acidic and improve red clovers nitrogen-fixing activity. Nutrients should be added to the soil on the basis of a soil test. Starter fertilizer applications up to 23-69-23 kilograms per hectare may benefit red clover seedings. Soil test recommendations that exceed this amount should be incorporated into \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 111the seedbed prior to planting. Red clover should be top dressed annually with fertilizer as long as the plant numbers are sufficient for economic production. When the red clover makes up less than 30 percent of the clover-grass mix, apply 34 or 57 kilograms of N per hectare on sandy or clay soils, respectively. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 67 and 68, respectively. Under dry conditions irrigation is essential to maintain red clover. Irrigation should be applied after each mowing by a dosage of 50-60 mm water.

            " 112 Harvesting Red clover quality is comparable with alfalfa quality under similar harvest schedules However, intake by the consuming animal is generally greater for alfalfa than red clover. Red clover quality does not decline as rapidly with maturity as does alfalfa quality (Table 69). This means a longer period over which high-quality forage can be harvested. Spring-seeded red clover can be harvested three times during the seeding year if growing conditions are favorable. This more aggressive harvest management in the seeding year than has traditionally been implemented provides greater forage and nutrient yields and has not negatively affected yield in the year after establishment. In addition, the third harvest during early September will help maintain better stands the following harvest season. Initial harvest 6070 days after seeding and subsequent harvest on a 30 to 35 day interval will generally allow for three harvests during the seeding year. Established red clover stands should be harvested at prebloom or early bloom. This harvest timing is a compromise between red clover yield and quality. Red clover silage, if properly harvested and stored, provides a high-quality forage. However, red clover is more difficult to cure for hay than other legumes. Establishing with a forage grass will decrease red clovers curing time.

A fast-growing summer annual, berseem clover can produce up to 8 tons of forage (under irrigation). Its a heavy N producer and the least winter hardy of all true annual clovers. This makes it an ideal winterkilled cover before corn or other nitrogen-demanding crops in rotations. It can suppress weeds, prevent erosion, and can be utilized as green manure, chopped forage or by grazing. Egyptian clover is not as drought-tolerant as alfalfa. Some cultivars can tolerate more soil moisture (but not waterlogging) than alfalfa or sweet clover. Winterkilled berseem allows for earlier spring planting than winter-hardy annuals. As dead organic mulch, it poses no moisture depletion risk, but may slow soil warming and drying compared to erosion-prone bare fallow. Figure 38 Egyptian (berseem) clover Botanical characteristics Egyptian clover is a summer annual or winter annual legume, similar in seed size to crimson clover. It has a tap root and a shallow 15 to 20 cm feeder root system. It is bee-friendly because its white or ivory blossoms have no tripping mechanism (Figure 38). Environmental requirements Berseem prefers slightly alkaline loam and silty soils but grows in all soil types except sands. Soil phosphorus and boron can limit berseem clover growth. Berseem tolerates saline conditions better than alfalfa and red clover. Cultivation Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 70 and 71, respectively. Irrigation can be appied if necessary, to promote germination. Green mass increases if irrigated by 30-35 mm doses.

The energy rich fodder beets are complementing the use of grass or protein rich legumes in the diet of the cattle. In many countries fodder beet serves as the reliable winter storage of feed. The yield and forage quality of beets does not vary much from year to year. This brings security and stability in planning - both in field and stable. It can be used for ethanol and energy production, too. Its yield is 40-80 t root/ha. Botanical characteristics Fodder beet is a biannual root crop. Its typical root forms can be seen on Figure 39. Figure 39 Fodder beet varieties: Flat globe (A), cylinder (B), globe (C), spindle (D) Environmental requirements It has high water requirement, 550-600 mm precipitation in the course of the growing period. The good distribution of precipitation in the summer has a yield-determining role. It has a good adaptibility to extensive conditions as well. It prefers semi-cohesive loamy Chernozems, Luvisols etc. It requires neutral or slightly alkaline pH.

Rotation must be 4 years. It is the best to sow after small grain cereals. Fodder beet is a deep rooted crop so soil must be well drained and subsoiled to enable the roots to explore water and nutrients throughout the profile. A good seedbed providing fine but firm conditions is essential for a good crop of beet. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 73 and 74, respectively. Irrigation may be necessary to promote germination (10-15 mm), later a regular irrigation (40-60 mm/14-21 days) can be applied. \n",

These can be fed whole to stock. High dry matter varieties tend to sit further in the ground and require a sugar beet harvester to lift them. Due to the higher dirt tare and hardness of the root, these varieties may need to be chopped and washed before feeding. After wilting, the tops may be fed to stock and can contribute a further yield of 3-4 tons protein rich dry matter per hectare. 2.9.2. Turnip (Brassica rapa L. var. rapa) Turnip is a highly nutritious forage crop that has a short growing season and can provide late fall grazing after other forage crops are finished for the year. It is a root Brassica crop which has been used as a vegetable for human consumption since prehistoric times, and its root has been a popular livestock fodder for at least 600 years. It has the potential as pasture as well. In general, the root Brassicas are fast-growing, high yielding and well adapted to seeding into existing pastures with little or no tillage or to seeding into a conventionally prepared seedbed. Turnip produces high-quality forage if harvested before heading. Livestock eat the stems, leaves and roots of turnip plants. Above-ground parts normally contain 20-25% crude protein, 65-80% in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM), ca. 20% neutral detergent fiber \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 118 and ca. 23% acid detergent fiber. The roots contain 10 - 14% crude protein and 80 - 85% IVDDM. The high levels of glucosinolates can be a problem if turnip forage is fed for long enough. Glucosinolates are higher in older forage. Figure 40 Turnip Botanical characteristics Turnip is a biennial which generally forms seed the second year or even late in the fall in the first year if planted early in the spring. During the first or seeding year 8 to 12 erect leaves, 30 to 35 cm tall are produced per plant. Turnip leaves are usually light green, thin and sparsely pubescent (hairy). In addition, a white-fleshed, large global or tapered root develops at the base of the leaf petioles. The storage root varies in size but usually is 7.5 to 10 cm wide and 15 to 20 cm long. The storage root can overwinter in areas of mild winter or with adequate snow cover for insulation and produce 8 to 10 leaves from the crown in a broad, low-spreading growth habit the following spring. Branched flowering stems 30 to 90 cm tall are also produced. The flowers are clustered at the top of the raceme and are usually raised above the terminal buds. Turnip flowers are small and have four light-yellow petals (Figure 40). Environmental requirements Brassicas are both cold-hardy and drought-tolerant. They can be planted late-even as a second crop-and provide high-quality grazing late in the fall. Turnip planted in July will provide grazing from September to November. The most vigorous root growth takes place during periods of low temperature (4.4 to 16 C) in the fall. The leaves maintain their nutritional quality even after repeated exposure to frost. Turnip grows best in a moderately deep loam, fertile and slightly acid soil. Turnip does not do well in soils that are of high clay texture, wet or poorly drained. For good root growth turnip needs a loose, well aerated soil. Cultivation Turnip can be cultivated in rotation only. Early harvested forecrops are the best, e.g. winter barley, forage mixes, green pea, crimson clover. Turnip seed is small and it is essential that it be seeded into a fine, firm seedbed with adequate moisture for germination. Plough and disk or harrow to produce a seedbed that is \n",

            " 119fine, firm and free of weeds and clods. Turnip can also be seeded into a sod or into stubble of another crop with minimum tillage. Good soil fertility is very important for good yields. Soil tests should be taken to assure proper fertilization. Acid soils should be limed to pH 6.0. Fertilizers should be applied at the time of seeding or within 3 days of seeding to give the crop a competitive edge on weeds. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 75 and 76, respectively. Weeds are generally not a problem once the turnip crop is established.

In some cases, diseases can lead to crop failure if rotation or other control measures are not used. Resistant varieties are available for some diseases. To prevent problems with diseases, Brassicas should not be grown on the same site more than two years in a row. If clubroot is a problem, rotation should be six years. Pests Turnip crops are attacked by flea beetles, by common turnip louse or aphid. Harvesting Its harvesting can be fractionized, started at the end of September. Normally it is harvested in November when the weight of roots reaches 0.5-0.6 kg. Roots have to be harvested with leaves together. It is suitable for silage making, for example with corn stalk together. Yields of forage turnip range 20-40 tons of leafy root/ha or 7-10 tons of dry matter/hectar when harvested or grazed about 90 days after planting. Turnip plants are ready for grazing or green-chop when the forage is about 30 cm tall (70 to 90 days after planting). The pasture should be grazed for a short time and the livestock removed to allow the plants to regrow. If grazed, 1 to 4 grazing periods may occur, depending on planting date and growing conditions. The forage quality of turnip is sufficiently high, especially in protein, it should be considered similar to concentrate feeds, and precautions should be taken to prevent animal health problems. Livestock should not be hungry when put on pasture the first time so they do not gorge themselves. \n",

            " 1232.10. SUCCESSION PLANTING Succession planting refers to several planting methods that increase crop availability during a growing season by making efficient use of space and timing. There are four basic approaches that can also be combined: Two or more crops in succession: After one crop is harvested, another is planted in the same space. The length of the growing season, climate, and crop selection are key factors. For example, a cool season spring crop could be followed by a heat-loving summer crop. Same crop, successive plantings: Several smaller plantings are made at timed intervals, rather than all at once. The plants mature at staggered dates, establishing a continuous harvest over an extended period (e.g. lettuce). Two or more crops simultaneously: Non-competing crops, often with different maturity dates, are planted together in various patterns (e.g. intercropping and companion planting). Same crop, different maturity dates: Several varieties are selected, with different maturity dates: early, main season, late. Planted at the same time, the varieties mature one after the other over the season. Catch cropping is a type of succession planting. Catch crop is a fast-growing crop that is grown simultaneously with (grown between rows, harvested before main crop), or between successive plantings of a main crop (between spring harvest and fall planting). It makes more efficient use of growing space (Table 79). Table 79 Forage catch crops Sowing date Seed/ha Green mass t/ha Harvesting Fodder rape 1. June -10. August 2,000,000 10-25 from 1.

Metzger) Oilseed radish as catch crop is generally planted to improve soil quality for economic crop production. It has the ability to recycle soil nutrients, suppress weeds and pathogens, break up compaction, reduce soil erosion, and produce large amounts of biomass. Freezing temperatures below -8 C will kill oilseed radish which allows for successful no-till spring planting of subsequent crops. As a fast growing, cool season crop, oilseed radish is best utilized when planted after small grain (e.g. wheat) or corn silage harvest. Depending on soil and growing area, its green mass is 10-40 t/ha. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 124 Botanical characteristics Oilseed radish has a large, fleshy taproot that can grow 5 to 7.6 centimeters in diameter and 30 cm or more in length. Above ground growth consists of wide leaves that are soft, moist, and fast growing. The foliage reaches 30 to 60 cm in height in a semi-erect stature (Figure 41). Leaf stems easily break from the main root, therefore traffic or grazing will destroy plant growth. Source: Todd Martin (MSU-KBS) Figure 41 Oilseed radish Environmental requirements It can be cultivated in every kind of semi-cohesive chernozems, forest soils and humic sandy soils which are suitable for second plant seeding. It requires little water in the first 2-3 weeks of growing. To get a big amount of green mass, 2-3 days of medium precipitation level are required at the end of August or first half of September.

            " 125Cultivation As a cool season crop, oilseed radish is best suited for early fall growth. Opportunities for planting oilseed radish in a cropping system would include: after small grain (e.g. wheat), after vegetable or sweet corn, after corn silage, or after early maturity soybean harvest. Cruciferae species and other early vegetables should be avoided as forecrop. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 80 and 81, respectively. Due to its fast growing ability, oilseed radish is capable of producing large amounts of biomass in a short period of time. Capturing and recycling of excess soil nutrients in biomass is one of the most important features of this cover crop. When planted after manure, sludge, or fertilizer application, oilseed radish may prevent water quality problems by storing nutrients in its biomass. Due to its fleshy composition (and low carbon: nitrogen ratio), the plant material easily decomposes and nutrients become available for the crop planted the following spring. Seed size is similar to alfalfa; therefore, when using a drill, a small seeder attachment is necessary. Broadcast seeding of oilseed radish can be done successfully if followed by light tillage incorporation. Utilization It can be utilized for grazing by sheep, goats, calves and beef from the middle of September. It keeps green till the permanent frosts. Frozen stalks can be grazed by sheep. Oilseed radish may have an allelochemical effect following decomposition that can help control soil-borne pests, including insects, weeds and nematodes. 2.10.2. White mustard (Sinapis alba L.) Similarly to oil radish, white mustard keeps vegetative stage if sown in the first half of August. Depending on soil and growing area, its green mass is 10-35 t/ha. If grown in the same area, on soils of poorer quality the oil radish, on soils of better quality the white mustard gives higher yield. Botanical characteristics and environmental requirements Environmental requirements, biological and physiological features are highly similar to those of oilseed radish (Figure 42).

Its height is 40-70 cm. Ground frost in fall do not hinder its development, while later it does not survive the longer frosts. Frozen stalks can be grazed by sheep or goats. 2.10.3. Phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.) Phacelia is a versatile plant that is primarily used as bee forage but it is important as forage, ornamental (unusual and attractive blooms, strong stems, long vaselife) and green manure, too. Phacelia is quick to grow and flower and grows well in dry soil. It does a good job of limiting nitrate leaching when planted in early fall. It winterkills at about -8 C and the residue breaks down quickly. It can be used as second crop in the summer. Phacelia is listed as one of the top 20 honey-producing flowers for honeybees and is also highly attractive to honeybees, bumblebees, and syrphid flies, and these insects are valuable pollinators. It also attracts other beneficial insects, such as parasitic wasps and minute pirate bugs. It provides both pollen and nectar. It can be succession sown so that it is in flower all season or it can be sown at a specific time to build up beneficial insect populations in anticipation of their need to control a crop pest. If there is a large area of phacelia planted, the planting should be timed so that phacelia flowers are not blooming when pollination of another crop is needed. Phacelia's habit of flowering abundantly and for a long period (4-8 weeks) can increase beneficial insect numbers and diversity, because it provides high quality nectar (sugar: 28%) and pollen. Four to six bee families can be settled to 1 ha phacelia, producing more than 800 kg/ha honey. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            " 127Botanical characteristics Phacelia is an herbaceous, non-leguminous, flowering annual in the Hydrophyllaceae family. Height ranges from 15 to 120 centimeters. The foliage appears ferny, and the flowers are in flat-topped clusters in shades of purple or occasionally white (Figure 43). Flowering continues for 6 to 8 weeks. Phacelia is a long-day plant and requires a minimum of 13 hours of daylight to initiate flowering. Phacelia is comparable to buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) in many ways. Cultural differences are that buckwheat germinates more readily - especially at higher soil temperatures, and phacelia is more tolerant of cold and drought. Source: Rasbak Figure 43 Phacelia Environmental requirements The optimum soil temperature for germination is between 3 20 C (soil temperatures closely follow air temperatures). It does not require much water during the vegetation period but to achieve high yields, moderately warm, humid climate is needed till flowering. Wet or compacted soils reduce germination success. It requires semi-cohesive Chernozems and Luvisols. It is not suitable for soils of less than 1.2% humus content. Cultivation Best forecrops are manured row crops and fibre crops as well as small grain cereals (winter wheat, winter barley). Forecrops susceptible for white mold (e.g. rape, mustard, sunflower, carrot) and monoculture should be avoided. Basic fertilization and sowing data can be found in Tables 84 and 85, respectively. Table 84 Nutrient requirement of phacelia Nutrient uptake as green forage or green manure: N: 2.3 kg/t P2O5: 1.5 kg/t K2O: 3.2 kg/t CaO: 1.0 kg/t MgO: 0.4 kg/t Harvesting Phacelia is suitable for usage as fodder or pasture until the beginning of flowering (Table 86). \n",

They are highly important in areas having restricted possibilities for grazing and can be easily inserted into various crop rotation systems. Their production is simple and does not need much energy and investment it suits for ecological farming systems as well. In general, best quality can be achieved if harvested prior to full flowering. Depending on the combination, it lasts for 5-7 days. Abundant yield of worsening quality can be conserved as silage or hay. 2.11.1.

Introduction According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a matured person should consume daily 400 grams of vegetable (excluding potato) to live a healthy life. Similarly, the Government of Nepal suggests a daily intake of 375 grams of vegetables (excluding potato). However, insufficient access to market and seasonal fluctuation of available vegetable makes it difficult to intake sufficient amount of vegetable for rural households. Thus, a home garden in rural Nepal is very essential where people can regularly grow vegetables in small piece of land. However, it is also commonly seen that many rural households do not apply appropriate cultivation techniques, which result in limited production, and frequent occurrences of pest and diseases attacks. As a result, it is compellation to enjoy with limited production of vegetables. Hence, by utilizing effective techniques in home gardens with good seed and appropriate vegetable cultivation technologies, vegetable production can be significantly increased. This will enable the rural households to secure more vegetable for their consumption. At last, it will further contribute to the healthy lives of the rural population.

Concept of vegetable production in home gardens The objective of vegetable production in home garden is to produce vegetable to support daily intake for the family members throughout the year. In regards to this point, home garden shall not aim only at increasing the amount of vegetable for a single production, but also aim at constant and sustainable production throughout the year. For this reason, the following concepts should be applied. \n",

This should be kept in mind when planting vegetable, so that vegetable can be harvested throughout the year. Vegetable crops should be grown in garden in the ratio of required vegetable on daily basis. Table 2.1 Sample cropping pattern in home garden Month Timing of Harvest Crop A Crop B Crop C Crop D Crop E Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Source: JICA Project Team Furthermore, it should be noted that if the same vegetable is grown in the same plot every year, there will be a high possibility of disease / pest outbreak. Thus, the same plot should not be used basically for the same kind of vegetable for more than four years. Based on the above table, a cultivation plan (a schedule deciding what vegetable to be planted in which plot) should be prepared and applied for home garden vegetable production.

In doing so, the first or second vegetable fruits would be better to be kept. Selecting better vegetable fruits will result in better production in the next harvest. Fig. No. 2.2.1: Seeds of Different Vegetables Source: JICA Project Team 2.3 Use of perennial vegetables Perennial vegetables like: chili (Akabare Khorsani), dundu (Chhepi type leafy green vegetable), squash, tree tomato, Kangkong, wild spinach, (Jibre saag), turmeric, ginger, Chayote (lettuce), Lamb's quarter (Bethe), etc., can be cultivated in the home garden.

It also helps to maintain the soil fertile. Therefore, legume crops should be frequently included in the production of vegetable in home gardens. 2.5 Use of local material, means and technology Local resources, means and technology should be utilized to the maximum extent, in order to minimize the work and maximize the production of vegetable. 2.5.1 Use of compost made from local material Well ripened compost manure should be used more in kitchen garden rather than chemical fertilizers. Crop residue of vegetables and other weeds in garden after harvest can be used for preparing compost. 2.5.2 Use of mulch to maximize the use of water Waste water from kitchen and bathroom (after washing vegetables, utensils and clothes or taking bath) can be used to irrigate the kitchen garden during dry season. As securing of water for irrigation is often a problem faced in the home gardens in the mid-hill areas, mulching has to be followed. By covering (mulching) the soil surface with locally available material, it can be effectively utilized in the vegetable farm. Material that can be used for mulching: straw, dry leaves, ashuro, titepati, etc. Fig. No. 2.4.1: Legume crops included in kitchen garden Source: JICA Project Team Fig. No. 2.5.1.1: Crop residue kept for preparing compost.

Possible to provide favorable growth conditions i.e. germination as well as growth Improved crop uniformity. Easy to produce strong and healthy seedling, saplings Maximum germination rate, and thus cost effectiveness Nursery can be prepared in unfavorable season. 3.1.2 Factors to be considered for raising a nursery Location of the nursery should be: Land close to the house Well exposed to the sun, but protected against severe heat Well protected against animal damage and strong winds Vegetable crops can be grown in two ways; either by sowing seed straight in the field, or by preparing seedlings in seedbeds and transplanting the seedlings in the permanent area. In general, the vegetables that are grown directly sowing seeds are - chamsur, spinach, beans, cow pea, radish, turnip, peas, pumpkin, sponge squash, etc.; whereas, the vegetables that are grown preparing seedlings are - cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, broad leaf mustard, swish chard, Jiriko saag, onion, asparagus, tomato, brinjal, chilly etc. In addition to, the small seedlings of the cauliflower species should be re-transplanted to another bed in distance, which is known as hardening of seedlings. 3.2 Different types of nursery bed 3.2.1 Raised nursery bed (For rainy season) This type of seed bed is useful during rainy season from June to September. But, if possible, sky nursery bed is very good option during rainy season (sky nursery bed is described below in 3.2.2 number) Raised up beds are made with 15 cm ridges in 1 meter in breadth and length as per need (Maximum 3 meters). While preparing such raised bed, it is better to use paddy field soil or use of fungicide to make the soil free from disease. \n",
            "---------------\n",
            "Vegetable Farming Technique Manual 8 Well-decomposed compost should be added and mix properly in soil during bed preparation about 1-2 weeks before sowing seed. Seeds are sown in line 2-3 cm deep with finger at spacing of 5-7 cm between two seeds, and slightly watered the bed by sprinkler or with the help of making hole on lead of bottles. 3.2.2 Sky nursery bed (For rainy season) Sky nursery beds are prepared in rainy season for producing seedlings of winter vegetables. During the months of June to September, rainfall is likely to continue for days if not weeks. In this period, raised nursery beds may not be sufficient in draining excess water, because rainwater will be frequently running on the ground. Furthermore, intensive rainfall falling directly on the seedlings are likely to damage leafs and hamper the production of healthy seedlings. By elevating the nursery from the ground, the seedlings will not be affected by the water running on the ground surface at times of rain, and it helps to prevent damaging leafs of the seedling from direct rainfall to it, by making the roof of white plastic sheet. The nursery bed is prepared using wooden or bamboo stalks driven on ground and erecting about 60-70 cm above the ground with 1 m breadth and length as per the necessity, and placing 15-20 cm thick layer of soil on the planks or bamboo fibers. If it rains, the nursery bed should be roofed by plastic sheet; whereas, it can also be removed if it is not raining. There should not be roof for long time in sky bed. Application of compost and sowing methods are like in raised bed. Fig. No. 3.2.1.1: Raised bed Source: JICA Project Team Fig. No. 3.2.2.1: Sky nursery bed Source: JICA Project Team \n",

In contrast to the rainy season, rainfall is scarce and preparation of seedlings will require water during the months of February to May. During such season, nursery beds should be prepared to contain the moisture in the soil as much as possible. To prepare such nursery, the land should be dig out below the ground surface and keep the small raised boundary. The water would be preserved in effective way in comparison to raised bed; which help to grow up healthy seedlings. Application of compost and sowing methods are like in raised bed. 4. Seasonal Vegetable and Time of Cultivation Vegetable produced in the mid-hill areas of our country is generally grouped in to three: A) Summer vegetable, B) Vegetable during rainy season, and C) Vegetable during the winter or dry season. Furthermore, the cultivation period of the each group is different from each other.

The seed sowing spot should be dug well before sowing. (B) Manure application To make the soil rich in micro nutrients, well decomposed compost manure or farm yard manure have to be applied. While preparing land for sowing seeds dig arm length deep and arm length breadth pit. Half of the pit should be filled up with well mixed upper soil and 1-2 kg compost in lower part of pit, and remaining half one should be filled up with soil in upper part. Only then, the seeds have to be sown. Fig. No. 5.1.1.1 Preparing the compost Source: JICA Project Team \n",

            "Vegetable Farming Technique Manual 26 5.1.2 Sowing / transplanting In case of direct sowing, it is good to sow seeds 7-14 days after compost filling in the pit. Sow 3-4 seeds in a 2-3 cm deep trench. After a month of germination, a healthier seedling should be kept and the rest should be removed. In case of transplanting seedlings, it should 7-10 cm tall with 4 - 5 true leaves in each seedling. One seedling should be transplanted at one place. In case of growing more than one pumpkin plant, bottle gourd or sponge gourd, the space should be at least 1.2 2.4 meter apart. Cucumber varieties can be spaced 0.9 meter apart. 5.1.3 Providing supporting trellis and training pruning (A) Trellis The trellis is important for cucurbit group plants. To get more yields, supporting the vine in vertical way is preferred. Wooden stake or tree branches can be put near the plant as trellis.

Allow the plant to grow without any lateral branches and tendrils up to about 12 nodes of stem. Then, the main stem should be pruned. By this pruning, laterals growing from the nodes can arise. We should not allow any laterals branches from plant below the trellis, and should put them upward on the trellis. Lightly tie the stem with the trellis using a string, and prune those tendrils which go above the trellis. 5.1.4 Watering (Irrigation) Do not ever let the soil completely dry out as cucurbits family plants need a lot of water. Collecting the waste water from kitchen and bathroom can also be used for the vegetable in kitchen garden. Waste water from dish washing utensils and bathroom can be collected by digging small pit or in a plastic tank or bucket. 5.1.5 Weeding Weeding is necessary for loosening soil and controlling the weeds. First weeding has to be done at the time of putting additional fertilizer, and second weeding would be better at the time of covering plant root by soil. 5.1.6 Top dressing (Additional fertilizer application) In case of direct sowing, about 15-20 days after sowing, apply about 1 kg of well decomposed compost or FYM around the base of each plant.

If it is available, a tea spoon (2-3 grams) urea can be applied as top dressing after 25-30 days of transplantation near to each plant, and cover it by soil. Cow's or buffalo's urine can be used as top dressing. One part of Cow's or buffalo's urine can be mixed with 4/5 part of water, and it should be sprinkled at the circle of 20 30 cm around the plant. After a month of first weeding, or when the plant starts flowering, about 2 kg compost should be applied in each plant as second top dressing. 5.1.7 Seed production method of cucurbits from home/kitchen garden The following two things are very important while producing seeds from cucurbits in the kitchen garden: (A) Selection of plant The plant that is disease free and has tasty fruits should be selected. The plant that has properly grown up and comparatively yielded more fruits should be selected. The plant having leaves at shorter distance in stem should be selected. (B) Selection of fruit The fruit that looks properly grown and healthy should be selected. The second or the third fruit yielded in vine should be selected.

As a result, the fruits can be kept fresh for few days. But, it should not be kept out side. When fruits grow very larger, it gives pretty seed. Cucumbers grow very fast, sometimes it seems like they grow overnight. The plants should be checked daily for mature cucumbers. The cucumber with scars cuts and of the unusual sizes need to be picked early. The harvested fruit should not be kept in the sun. 5.3 Specific Methods for Pumpkin Cultivation Pumpkins are popular vegetable crop cultivated during summer-rainy season. The pumpkin is popular due to high yielding and holding good storage capacity. The tip of the vine 40 50 cm (young shoots) can be used as green vegetable.

It is best to harvest before the fruit grows sponge inside. 5.5 Specific methods for bitter gourd cultivation Like in other members of the cucurbits family, it is also a fast-growing, trailing or climbing vine with thin stems and tendrils. Thus, it requires a trellis to support their climbing vines. Bitter gourd is characterized by soft lengthwise ridges and uneven pebbly surface. Depending upon the variety type, its immature fruit is light to dark green, and have oblong or oval shapes with a pointed tip at the blossom end. Internally, the flesh is white with rough-edged seeds, somewhat similar to ridge gourd seeds in appearance. As the fruits begin to mature, they gradually become hard, turn yellow or brown in color. 5.5.1 Health benefits Bitter gourd notably contains insulin-like substances, Phyto nutrient, and polypeptide etc. mostly known to lower the blood sugar level.

Downy mildew can affect plants at all stages, but in many growing regions, it appears in late stage. Initial symptoms are small chlorotic spots on the upper leaf surface from the older leaves. Fungus of the downy mildew cannot be survived without live plants. Hence, to grow and survive such fungus, it is necessary of live cucurbit crops. (a) Cause of disease occurrence Downy mildew is caused by a kind of fungus (Pseudoperonospora cubensis) of water. Under humid conditions, downy mildew starts to develop underside of leaf, which causes on the underside forming the light yellowish lesions. This downy growth is particularly noticeable in the mornings or wet weather. (b) Integrated Pest Management Traditional practices to control pests Healthy and treated seeds should be used.

Sky nursery or raised nursery bed should be made for rainy season. Solanaceae group vegetable seed should be sown in a 2 cm (2-3 times deeper than seed) deep hole, at the gap of minimum 3-4 cm between each hole. After sowing seed in each hole, seed should be covered loosely by soil and mulching should provide with straw or dried leaves. Just after mulching or covering by straw or dried leaves, water should be sprayed over it in nursery seed bed. After 20-25 days, when seedlings become 2-3 leaves already, it will be ready for transplanting. 1-2 hours before uprooting the seedlings, the seed bed should be watered so that the seedlings come off easily without getting the roots damaging. If possible, it would be better to harden the seedling when it gets 2 weeks before transplanting in main field. At the time of hardening1, the seedlings have to be transplanted with plant to plant distance 12 cm and row to row distance 15 cm. After two weeks of hardening, the seedlings should only be transplanted to the main bed with 60 cm spacing between plants to plant, and maintaining the row to row distance with 80 cm apart. 1 Hardening refers to adopting the environment for seedlings by transplanting it from main nursery to next bigger nursery in distance before transplanting to the main field.

Second weeding should be done about 20-25 days after the first weeding or transplanting. Third weeding should be done just before the time of compost and urine is applied to the plant. (40-45 days of transplanting). In case farmers directly sow the seeds in main field without making nursery bed, first weeding is done in 15 - 20 days after the seed germinate. The second and third weeding are as same as in case of transplantation case. The weeds cannot make much trouble to the plants after they grow to a height over 50-60 cm. Therefore, initial period of seedling growth is very sensitive time for weed control. We should be careful to make covering the plant by soil to the base of plant just after every weeding, which help to prevent the lodging and making good root growth.

Tomato plants cannot withstand frost and high humidity. Too much high temperature and too low temperature (average temperature below 16C & above 27C) is not also desirable. It required low to medium rainfall. 7.2.1 Health benefit It has a great medicinal value as well, and it contains high amount of carotenoid called lycopene. 7.2.2 Types of tomato Mainly, tomato plant has been categorized into three groups based on the growth of plant and nature of flowering: determinate (dwarf plant), semi-determinate (in middle type of them) and indeterminate (taller type of plant) varieties. They bear flower or fruit on every third node. In determinate type, the main stem of plant is stopped after 5-6 cluster setting. In the indeterminate type, the main stem of the plant grows continuously. First branch grows from the bottom of the stem, and other branches grow from other above nodes. It would be better the determinate and semi-determinate varieties for home garden farming, and the indeterminate types for commercial farmers. \n",

            "Vegetable Farming Technique Manual 52 (A) Determinate type plant These tomato plants have less height of approximate 1.0 m with fruiting and flowering on same time. Generally, determinate tomato is early maturity types. This type of plant has the characteristics of fruiting and flowering in the gap of every one leaf or one node, by which plant become dwarf. At least 2 branches from bottom should be kept on the plant for getting more yields. As it requires a limited amount of staking for support, it is perfectly suited in kitchen garden farming. Examples of dwarf variety of tomato (determinate or semi determinate) are BL 410, Pusa early, Durbarg, Surakshya, NS 2535, NS 815 etc. are cultivated in Nepal. (B) Semi-determinate type plant The growth habit of semi-determinate tomatoes is somehow between the true determinate and true indeterminate tomatoes. Most semi-determinate varieties are technically indeterminate plants that are bushy type due to their shorter vines. At least 2 branches should be kept on the plant for getting more yields. (C) Indeterminate tomato plant Indeterminate tomato plant requires many tall staking or threads (rope) for supporting plant. First side shoot grows from the bottom of the stem, and other side shoots grow from other above nodes. For the better yield, the tip of main stem should be cut after plant gets height of 1-1.2 meter with 5 clusters of fruits.

In indeterminate types, ridges are necessary to cultivate until rainy season for drainage of rain water. In rainy season (July to August), 15 cm high ridges need to be made to transplant seedlings for prevention from rain water. A shade with a plastic roof is better for rainy season to cover the plants if this facility is available. The gap between the ridges (row row distance) should be at least 80 cm with 60 cm spacing between the plants in each row for determinate and semi determinate varieties. It is better to adopt crop rotation system (change the place of plantation every year in different corner of kitchen garden). It is not good to cultivate Solanaceae vegetable such as Tomato, Potato, Chili and Brinjal in the same crop rotation.

It also helps in keeping the plant healthy and improves size, color and shape of fruits. Remove the tip of plants to increase the size of fruits. In a kitchen garden, the main stem of indeterminate varieties will be pruned at 4-5 leaves stage, and two side shoots should be kept on the plant. Then, other side shoot should be removed from the plant time to time if we saw more side shoots are emerging. Maximum of two main stems can be kept while the old leaves at the bottom of the plant, yellow and infected leaves should be timely removed. Timely pruning can help in number of fruits, productivity, quality and uniformity in size of the fruits. Pruning work makes to increase the number of fruits in per unit. The pruning of unnecessary parts should be removed no sooner as it is found. Otherwise, if delayed to remove the young side shoots grown from leaves, it consumes the nutrients, which weakens the plant and results in decrease the yields.

Possible benefits of mixed cropping are as followings: It helps to balance nutrients in the soil. It helps to eliminate the weeds and pest problems in the field. It helps to minimize the crops from the effect of unfavorable climate condition (wet, dry, hot, cold) to suppress plant diseases, to increase overall productivity and to utilize the land up to its full capacity. If cauliflower and mustard are grown together, mustard can be used as short-term crop and can harvest earlier, on cauliflower can be harvested later. Mustard can work as trap crop, which can somehow minimize the pests attack in the cauliflower because pest goes to attack the mustard, and cauliflower remains safe. 8.2 Specific Methods for Cauliflower Cultivation Cauliflower can be categorized in three types based on its maturity days after transplanting. They are as followings: Early maturity (crop ready for harvest in 40-45 days in warm area) Medium maturity (crop ready for harvest in 60-75 days in Mid hills) Late maturity (crop ready for harvest in 80-140 days in Mid hills) In Nepal, generally, medium and late maturity varieties are cultivated.

While doing so, if there is condition of lodging seedlings, it can be staked with small sticks. Watering to the plants should be done every day for one week. 8.2.5 Harvesting We want to pick the cauliflower once the head is full and big size, but the best time to cut cauliflower is when the diameter of head becomes 15-20 cm. Generally, when the head reaches about the size of 5-7 cm in diameter, simply pull up about three or four large leaves and tie them loosely around the cauliflower head for better quality cauliflower production. The mature head should be firm, compact, and white. When it is ready to harvest the cauliflower head, cut it from the main stem with a few of the outer leaves attached with head to protect the head from injury and prolong its overall quality. It should be sure to handle the head carefully as it can be injured. Best time for harvesting cauliflower is in the morning time after the dues go dry or in the evening time when it turns cool. The harvested cauliflower should not be kept in sunlight. Once it is harvested, its usually recommended that the head should be soaked in salt water (1 tea spoon salt to 1 litter water) for about 20-30 minutes. This will help to ooze out pesticides that are present in head. Fig. No. 8.2.4.1: Transplanting cauliflower seedlings Source: JICA Project Team \n",

Step- 5: Protection from fungus infection As the wound of the cauliflower can be attacked by fungal, the white ash should be applied on the wound in the same day. Step-6: Nursing While nursing, provide well-composted farm yard manure and fertilizer around cauliflower plant, and water in it at every 1 week interval. Also, remove old leaves from the plant, which minimize the disease and pest attack in the plant. Step-7: Supplementary pollination To increase the pollination, gently shake the plant at flowering time, which helps in good pollination. Step-8: Removing unnecessary flowers and providing stake After the cauliflower plant bears sufficient amount of seeds, the unnecessary part of flowers should be cut off. It helps in proper development of seeds in plant. At this time, provide wooden stake to the cauliflower plant in garden. Step-9: Seed harvesting After seeds are ripened, the pods get dry. Pick the pods when they are dry well. After picking the pod, it should be dried for 1-2 days, and get seeds from pods. Then, let the seeds dry for 2-3 days in sunlight and store them reducing seed moisture level up to 7-8%. \n",

We can also prepare like sunken nursery bed, and put the seeds in each trench in the kitchen garden near by the water source. (B) Manure Application If the Kangkong is grown on field, manure application is not mandatory, but incase grown in pot or container, we should add the Nitrogenous fertilizer as top dressing in every week by cattle urine or urea. 9.2.4 Sowing In moist soil condition, the seed should be sown in the bed of 60-100 cm wide. Seeds can be sown either directly or nursery-grown seedlings can be transplanted into the main beds. Seeds should be no more than 2 years old, and can be soaked for 24 hours before sowing to promote well germination. Soil temperature requirement for germination is 20 C. 9.2.5 Harvesting A first harvesting period of Kangkong is usually 4 to 6 weeks after planting, depending upon the temperature and growing conditions. While harvesting, cut or pinch only a few leaves or entire plant with leaves and stems leaving only 8-9 cm stem of each plant in the bed. Plant will re-grow again through this way of harvesting. Both stems and leaves of Kangkong can be consumed. Kangkong which is growing on the field, one should be careful that its an invasive plant and grows aggressively in broad range.

They grow best in a deep, loose soil that retains moisture as well as have good drainage capacity. Land surface should be flattened and water should not be logged in. Land should be prepared by plowing land 4-5 times, and the surface should be flattened. Specially, root crops require more loose and deep soil for the well growth of root inside soil. Therefore, clods should be crushed, and fine plowing should be done during land preparation.

Introduction Generally Nepalese farmers have the practice of collecting FYM from their livestock shed as an organic fertilizer for their crop fields. Farm Yard Manure is the manure prepared in decomposed from by collecting dung and urine of farm animals along with wastes feeds, fodder, and the bedding materials. FYM is the main organic manure used in Nepal. However, Nepalese farmers have the practice of applying immature (un-decomposed) FYM in their field. Immature manure FYM can cause the generation of harmful gas ammonia and wilting, and disturb for well germination of seeds. And, also the immature (un-decomposed) manure does not improve soil conditioning capacity of increasing water holding and fertilizer holding ability. Weed seeds can also survive inside manure and as a result, weeds problems occur in the field. Well decomposed FYM can solve many crop growth problems in the fields. 2. Advantages of Well Decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM) 2.1 Improvement of soil productivity Application of well decomposed FYM in soil act as a soil conditioner which is capable of improving moisture holding, fertilizers holding and air passing capacity; as well as it helps the capacity of drainage to soil in good balance. This type of soil is very useful for good growth and development of plants. By the application of well decomposed FYM, some portions of nutrients are available directly to the plants, and remaining nutrients in soil is released to plants for long time. The materials that soak urine should be used as bedding materials in animal shed which can help to minimize the loss of urine. Otherwise, we can also make the urine collecting place separately with plastic or cemented structure, and use urine as fertilizers. By using well decomposed FYM in field, fewer amounts of chemical fertilizers are also enough for crop, which can also save the money. Table No. 2.1 Composition of FYM \n",

It is important to protect manure from sunlight and rain to protect micronutrients; otherwise the micronutrients in the manure will be lost. 4.3 Actual Procedure for collecting and using FYM The fresh dung together with bedding materials should be collected daily from animal sheds to the first storage place up to 2 months properly, and let it remains for next 2 month by covering it with dry leaves, straw or plastic sheet. After fulfilling the manure in first storage place, the manures should be collected daily to the next storage place. Put the manure in next storage up to 2 months and cover it like as in first place, and let it remains for next two months. The manure already becomes fermented in first place up to two months, when we are collecting dung in second place. So, we can apply the manure from first place to the field, and the first place will become empty and we can collect the dung again on first place. This cycle continue on every two month period on first and second places. This way, we can get well fermented FYM. 5. Condition Required for Well Decomposition of FYM Well decomposition of manure is required for making good FYM. For making well decomposed manure, the following things should be considered well during its preparation: After piled up the fresh FYM, moisture content of the FYM should be managed 50-65%. It can be known by squeezing the manure in palm of hand, if it is wet. If moisture is less, water should be sprayed, and if moisture is high, the manures should be dried in shadow by removing cover for 1-2 days. The fresh FYM temperature rises up to 70 degrees Celsius within 2 to 3 weeks (1 week in summer) after deposition, which is not good for well decomposition of FYM. Therefore, we should be careful for turning over at every 60 C for two to three times. It can be known by putting hand inside the manure and feel hot. \n",

            "Vegetable Farming Technique Manual 116 The manure has to be covered with a plastic sheet or straw or dried leaves or mud to protect rain and direct sunlight. FYM will be ready to use from first place after 2 months of filling it. 6. Collection of Animal Urine and Its Advantages 6.1 Collection of urine Urine can also be collected and preserved for separate use or for mixing in manure by following method: The floor of cattle shed should be cemented to collect urine. To collect the urine, cemented tank should be constructed at first, and then urine could be collected in plastic tank. By making a pit in a corner of the shed, urine can also be collected Fig. No. 6.1.1 Cattle urine collection through pipe from shed Source: JICA Project Team Fig. No. 6.1.2 Cattle urine collection through drain Source: JICA Project Team 6.2 Advantage of collecting urine The urine can be collected separately, and used as fertilizer since it has three times more nitrogen than in dung. Urine also can be used to control the disease and pests in crops. This can be sprayed in 5 to 7 days gap by mixing 1 part of urine with 4-5 parts of water. \n",

Separate collection of urine will help to sanitize and dry animal shed. The urine can be used together with water as fertilizer. 7. Things to Be Considered While Making Farm Yard Manure (FYM) The FYM should not be dried under the sun to decrease its weight, which will cause the loss of nutrients. The FYM should not be left on field in small heaps for long time as the nutrients will be lost. Instead of leaving the FYM in individual heaps, it would be better 4 to 5 bamboo baskets of manure collection in one heap, and covered with straw, dried leaves, plastic, etc., which will help to protect the nutrients.

Introduction Compost manure can be prepared as alternative to FYM. Compost making is the best option for the farmers who dont rear the animals or cattle's with them. Compost manure is decomposed mixture of straws, grasses, fodder, ash, leaves and other parts of trees, farm waste, kitchen waste and similar material, together with dung if possible. Compost manure is generally prepared in pit or heap by making different layers of raw materials covering with mud or plastic. One wooden stake or bamboo is put in the middle for well development of bacteria and to be decomposed. The temperature inside the manure should be felt hot. While we put our hand inside the manures, the temperature is up to 50-60C at that time. \n",

            "Vegetable Farming Technique Manual 119 Emulsifying concentrate (E. M.) should be sprayed in each layer of the grasses or straw or other raw materials during the preparation of manure for quick decomposition of the manure. 9. The Advantages of the Compost Manure It provides necessary nutrients to the soil for improving its fertility. Increases the water absorbing capacity of soil. Improves the physical, chemical and biological quality of soil. Increase air aeration and water movement in the soil. Manure can be kept in soil for long time. Increases the microbial activity in the soil; due to which soil become soft, and increase fertility status in the soil. Compost manure can be prepared in own accessible places, so that it will be easy for carrying manure in the field. 10. The Materials Required for Making Compost Manure Waste straws and grasses. Weeds, leaves fallen from trees. Roots and stems of young plants. Dung and urine of animals. Organic kitchen product ( vegetable, food wastes) Limestone, ash, urea, etc. 11. The Place for Making Compost Manure The near place from farm. Elevated & well drained place Place of easy care and observation. \n",

Methods of Preparing Compost Manure 12.1 Methods of preparing compost in pit 12.1.1 Digging pit It is better to dig a pit on winter season than in summer season due to which the chance of drying out of material is less. The length of the pit should be as per need, but depth should not be more than one meter. 12.1.2 Filling pit The collected raw materials for making compost manure should be kept arranging in layers inside the pit. Wooden stick or a bamboo should be put in the middle of the pit during filling materials inside the pit. Spraying water in each layer of compost during its preparation will help for making good compost manure. It is better to make each layer up to15-20 cm (1 to 1.5 hand span). We can also use dried leaves, green fodder, dung, water (2-3 liter of water in each layer), lime powder (100-200 gm. in each layer), E. M. liquid (Mixture of 1 liter E.M. and 10-15 liter water, and spray nearly 1 liter in each layer) and forest soil (2-3 kg. in each layer) between each layer which help to decompose the manure well. E.M. liquid, Dung, Urine, lime powder is not mandatory, but it is better to apply for producing well decomposed FYM. Lime powder preserves the manure from its acidity and increases the bacterial activities. Likewise, forest soil increases the bacterial numbers. The use of dung and urine between the raw materials will increase the quality of the compost. The raw materials should be forcefully pressed inside the pit so that it decays soon. \n",

            "Vegetable Farming Technique Manual 121 12.1.3 Using bamboo or wood stake for manure ventilation: During the winter and dry summer, the compost should be prepared by pit method due to which the moisture can be preserved inside the pit. In case the temperature inside the compost become so much hot (over than 70 C), bacteria cannot be survived and that will damage the compost, which will give the less quality of compost. Therefore, to maintain the temperature only up to 60 C, bamboo or wooden stake should be put during the time of compost preparation. The bamboo or wooden stake should be swing or stirred round by hand in every week for maintaining the temperature and passing air inside the manure, which will give well decomposed compost manure after 3-4 month. 12.1.4 Covering by mud or plastic After filling up the materials the pit should be covered with mud. Covering the pit with mud stops the spread of bad smell and preserves manure from rain, direct sun-light and from nutrient loss.

Make the different layers of straw, leaves, branches, fodders or grasses by putting dung or lime or soil in between each layer, and spray water together with E.M. liquid. The materials in heap should be tightly pressed so that it gets decomposed earlier. 12.2.3 Use of wooden or Bamboo frame for making compost on heap Heaps of material can be put inside the wooden frame or covering around by wooden stakes or bamboo stakes. The wooden or bamboo frame can be made as per desire, but the height should be 1-1.3 meter height. 12.2.4 Turn-over in heap method for compost making Generally, the turn-over of compost should be done when the temperature inside the compost is 60-65 C, which is identified by feeling very hot while we put hand up to 20 cm inside the compost. In case the temperature inside the compost become so much hot (over than 70 C), bacteria cannot be survived, and that will damage the compost, which will give the less quality compost.
